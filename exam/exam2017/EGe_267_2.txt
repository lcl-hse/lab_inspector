There is an opinion, that by giving longer sentences to judged people it is possible to reduce the level of crime. However, it may be not the only way to do that, but apparently, not the merciest one. It is also known that some people, who get in the prison in a young age, more likely will get there again. That is why the level of crime is enourmous in such areas where there are more people, who have been in a jail. 
On the one hand, it is logical, that longer sentences may stop people from doing crime. Apparently, when someone knows that by stealing something he will only be put in a jail for several month it may be not as effective as if someone knows that he will be there for several years. Still, as far as I understand it, any person who decides to do a crime, does not believe really that he will be captured. 
On the other hand, I believe that people will more likely never do a crime if they are not pushed to it by the environment and society around them. If there is a kid, who grows up in a criminal area or even criminal family, sometimes, even not wanting to do so, he has no other ways to survive there, than doing a crime. Moreover, by puting this kid in a jail and not giving him help there and thereafter to socialise and find a normal job and people to interact with, will most likely make him a life-long prisoner. Of course, if the sentences will be longer, it will be even harder to make a normal and socialised person out of him. 
In the conclusion, I would like to say that I believe there are a lot of alternative ways to reduce the crime level, such as rising the education level and providing psychological support for anyone, especially for those, who live in the cities and areas with a high level of crime and drug-addiction. These ways seem to be more and, moreover, will help those people to fully become a part of the society we live in.
