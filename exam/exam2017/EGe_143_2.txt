There are different political organizations which advice to organize a "Guaranteed Basic Income" system in some countries, which means that people will receive some money from the government monthly. This suggestion has both advantages and disadvantages and I would like to mention all of them. 
The benefits of this system are pretty obvious. Every person will get some money, which can also help in difficult situation. There are some people who are not in the category of old people or invalids, but they still can have problems with finances. Also every person in the country has a right to get some money from selling and reproducing the nation goods of their country. For example, many people in Russia are not satisfied, that they don't get anything from our natural goods, from selling gas, oil, gold and other things to other countries. 
However, this idea also has some disadvantages. Giving money from governmental budget to every citizen can be dangerous for economy of the country. It can lead to the growth of costs for different products, crisis and laziness of the population. It can take many years to stabilize the economic situation. Also, this system can lead to deficit of the governmental budget and decline of money given to some governmental organizations, like schools, hospitals and others. 
All in all, I would like to say that this system is not as good, as it is supposed to be and every county which wants to have it should be sure that they can afford it and improve it for their own country.
