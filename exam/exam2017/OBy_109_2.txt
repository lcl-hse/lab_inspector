This is true that musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies because copying and sharing music or films on the internet is theft and people who download these files instead of buying the original discs should be punished. 
First of all, not everyone knows how difficult to create some music or movies. This is realy hard work, that need lots of time, money and health to make really good stuff. 
Second we are all know that life is better when you can have something for free, because not everyone can afford to buy CD's or DVD for high price because video and music shops make % for each CD or DVD, so it's better to find things in the Internet just put the 'free' word searching. 
However, I think that not all of films and music cos their money, because now people that make movies or music think that they can do some junk-movie or junk-music, just to make a lot of money, and it's not quite good, because they are not artists; they just want your money, not respect. 
In the conclusion I want to say that not all of the producers or musicians desirve your money. Because they are not true with you or with themselves. I said that it is hard to create, but creating something to show people world inside you just because you want it; this is only desirve money and respect of people. And the persons who want just money just stupid fake artists.
