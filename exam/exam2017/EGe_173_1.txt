The first evident feature in chart is that in average men spend more time doing sport in England than women do. The biggest gap between two genders is in the age 16-24. The older age is, the less gap is. Only in age 55-64 women spend more time on sport and exercise than men. 
The common tendention is that both genders spend less time doing sport with getting older. Although, women's time spent on sport decreases gradually with age, while men are obviosly much more into sports in the youth. The gap in the young age between men and women is 168 minutes and in the age over 75 it is only 19,2 minutes. 
All in all, the chart shows that in Englang young men in age 16-24 are keen on sports in average and young women are not really, but through their lives all people spend some time of the day on sports, even men and women who are over 75 years old, and that feels inspiring to me.
