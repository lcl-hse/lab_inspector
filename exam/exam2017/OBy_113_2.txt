People, who produce music and films lose nowadays a lot of money, because of people, who do not buy the original legal copies of discs, but download it from illegal internet web-sites. It is a theft or not? I think, that it is not always right. 
From one point of viwe it will be too expensiv to buy always the original discs. Not all of us have enogh money for it. For example my friends cannot pay 300 or more rubles for each film, that they want to watch. Sometimes we need it not only for fun, but for instance for our stady. As a result people, who cannot pay, use the Internet and download all which they need for free, but I don't think, that they should be punished for it. 
From the other point of viwe, it is imposible to produse something, when you do not become money for it. A lot of producers use money, that they become from one film or music disc for producing of something new. I think, that when you realy like something, you should support people, who did it. For example, I buy discs of my favorit music groups, because I want to help them become some money for their work. I'm sure, that they realy need it and, when I have responsibility to do something for them I will do it. 
In conclusion I will say, that everybody must choose himself to pay or not to pay for music and films. I decided to support film and music makers.
