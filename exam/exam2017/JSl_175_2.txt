Is it possible to reduce crime by giving longer prison sentences of is it alternative ways? There is no simple answer on such difficult question. As it widely known the most of the crimes are made by those who already made them. Potentially people who are already in prison have more chances to make a crime so it could be a good idea to take them longer in prison but after all they still should be exit. The longer sentences can made prisoner more angry. What is the difference in prison between 10 years and 15 years? The world around us changes and the longer prison sentences means the harder returning to a normal life in society it creates big risks for those who only exit the prison after a long times. The main aim of the prison is to punish and improve the people, but does it actually improve people? For example in some Scandinavian countries prisoners have ability to reduse their time in prison by reading some books and then passing a tests about knowledge of this books. I think such things can help more than longer prison sentences. The longer prisoners are in prison the more it costs for the government. In fact those who does not make any crime should pay taxes for prisoners time in prison. It is possible to give them some work or social work at which they will earn money to reduce costs for the government. Overall, I think there a lot of better ways to improve people and help them to return to a normal life than give the, longer prison sentences.
