The bar-chart illustrates the situation on the book market field for four different countries that was in 2014 and will be in the next four years. We can see on the graph how much money each country spends on producing eBook and print book. 
According to the bar-chart USA is a leader in book printing, because they spend 10,5 billion dollars on print books. 
The country that reads the least noumber of printed books is the UK, inspite of that fact the difference between usage of eBooks and printed ones is the smallest and equalse only 0,8 percent. This chart shows us that all countries: USA, Germany, China, and even UK will spend more money on eBook in the future. 
They also will reduce spendings on print book, except Germany whose spendings will not change at all as we could see on the chart. The last main point is that Chine spends money on eBooks less than other countries and this amount of money is more than 10 times smaller than in the USA.
