There are a lot of different opinions on the topic what goverment should do to reduce crimes. It is a big problem of current life. Humans are devided into two groups: some people think that we should make the prison sentence longer, others think that there are a various ways to solve this problem. 
First of all, I should try to explain why the first group have such opinion. People believe that a long sentence in prison can be a good example for others. That other people think many times before doing a crime. Nevertheless, they don't think about people who can get into the prison by mistake. Such humans have to stay in prison for all their lifes or for a quite long sentence. 
I join for the second group of opinions. I believe that there are a lot of alternative ways to reduce a crime. At first, we should realise the real causes of a crime. We should learn, behave prisoners that prevent crimes. Moreover, in my opinion, making a prison sentences longer do not solve this problem. Many people know how it is bad to be in a prison, but they still do some crime. 
We should try to do people's life better to reduce the crime. It may be better to make attention on behaviour of people from the early age, from a school ot even kindergarden. 
People should make the attention on the causes of the crime and try to solve the problems which push people to do some crime. 
Why people, for instance, stole some products or other things? May be they have some problems with money or they have some phsihological problems, so it is better to solve such king of problems. Of course, it is may be difficult to do, but we should try. I believe that giving longer prison sentences has not got a good results. 
To conclude, I believe that people in near future can create some new way to reduce crime.
