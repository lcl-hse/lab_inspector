Manufactured goods transportation was the leader by roads, but transported manufactured goods by rail accounted for almost the same number. 
Looking at the detail, machinery goods accounted for only 2 per cent of all transported goods by road and it is the least number of at all. The second less number had metals transported by road, with 11%, as compared to chemicals goods and food products transported by rail.

In case of rail transportation manufactured goods were just over twice more than machinery goods (12%) and chemicals and food products.
