The bar charts compare the number of the white and non-white general and prison populations who lived in the USA and the UK in 2015. It can be seen from the first bar chart that the percentage of white general and prison populations in the UK was hefty, in comparison with the number of non-white people. Nevetheless, whilst the percentage of white prison people was lower than the number of white general population, the percentage of non-white people who were in prison was higher than general non-white population. 
As it is shown by the second bar chart, the situation in the USA was significantly different. The number of non-white prison people was considerably higher than the percentage of non-white general population. In comparison with this trend, the percentage of white general people is far more than the prison population. 
The main difference between two charts is that the number non-white prison people in the USA is higher than in the UK. 
Overall, it is evident that in the UK the percentage of both white populations was domanat, whereas in the USA there were significantly more non-white prison people.
