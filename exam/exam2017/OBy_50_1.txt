The pie charts illustrate the percentage of different materials transported by trains and vehicles between European countries 9 years ago. 
As it can be seen, transportation of metals differs significantly. It had been transported 35 per cents of goods by rail in comparison with 11 per cents by road. Consequently, it influenced the percentage of food products that replaced most of previous material spot, so here is a gap in 19 per cents. 
Nevertheless, there are material that have approximately the same percentage in transportation by both ways. For instance, chemicals and manufactured goods that have gaps in 5 and 3 per cents respectively. Moreover, such kind of good as machinery also has a difference in percentage. It was transported by train in 10 per cents more than by car. In comparison, non-metallic minerals have almost the same percentage but in another order. 
To conclude, some of materials is easier to transport by rail, like metals. However, food products need special conditions, so it is frequently transported by vehicles.
