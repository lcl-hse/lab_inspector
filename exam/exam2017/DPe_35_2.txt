Musicians and film-makers lose huge amounts of money from illegal pirate copies over the years. There is an opinion that copying and sharing music or films on the internet is theft and people who download these files, instead of bying the original discs, should be punished. 
It is very clear that those people, who are making the products are losing money from this, but in my opinion I will likely disagree whith this statement and punishment. 
First of all, to fight with thefts we need to punish not only the ones who are downloading this from the internet, rather than punish those who are copying and after this spreading and sharing those materials illegally, because those people are most likely cominiting the crime, not the other ones who are just taking the maximum from a free-place like an internet. 
Secondly, most of a times the main process of selling those products not the right one. Main argument against modern system is about not having a chanse to overwiev the material which we are bying. If you go to watch a film or to listen some music discs you must to pay for it before you will get access to overwiev it, when, in my opinion it is not very pleasant, because you are paying for a product, when it can appear as a low-quality one or which will not satisfy yourself. 
Therefore, in my opinion this process may be more pleasant in a way, when firstly you can download it for-free and if you satisfied with a product you can fund any amount of money to a content-maker. However with the discs it is obvious that we must to pay for it, because that is touchable product with spended money on them. But mostly it depend on the people's awareness of product price, if they are aware, the money will come to producers.
