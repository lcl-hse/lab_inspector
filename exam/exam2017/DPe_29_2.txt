The issue of pirate copies has grown in importance over the past few years. It is widely assumed that users have an obligatory to buy music and films to enjoy. From my point of view, that kind of facilities have to be free for everyone, so that I absoulutely disagree with this statement. 
To begin with, musicians and producers offer their creativity for rather expensive price. In this case fans would rather searching illegal pirate copies to listen to the music or to watch the film. They may browse the site which they do not know who created by, and watch adorable movie or song. It does not mean that the fan is a thief and the fan cannot imagine that may be punish. 
Moreover, people who make music and films have an opportunity to organize concerts and meetings. As a rule, tickets are extremely expensive. People who are addicted to their creativity but do not have enough money to buy the ticket for the entry would like to download track surfing the Internet so creators must do their work available for everyone not to lose fans. Now it is really common, stars make something just for money and all works are similar and do not have any individuality. So why people should waste money for downloading anything that have now differences? The Fans do not have to be punished for their crazy love. 
To conclude, punishment for the downloading is not effective. People always find alternative way to avoid payment. So, creators should make their creativity available for fans in the World Wide Web.
