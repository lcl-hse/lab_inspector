Financial stability had always been one of the most important human's preoccupations. That is why nowadays governments try to invent a beneficial system of rewarding for citizens to always have some capital in case of emergency. One of these experimental programs is "Guaranteed Basic Income", promising a sum of money paid monthly to everyone, whether a person has work or not. 
Obviously such a project has a vast number of advantages. Firstly, it guarantees life for everyone, recessing the spreading of poor and homeless population layers. Secondly, in the end the sum paid could be sent back to the government, stabilizing the taxes paying and the financial circulation in the bank system. Moreover, it would certainly improve the quality of life and strengthen the international authority of the country. 
However, there are some evident disadvantages. To begin with, the monthly paid sum of money could discourage population from work at all. Let us take the example of modern France, where similar law, concerning only people without any job, encourages thousands of migrants and poor people to benefit from it. What is more, every initiative connected with money could collapse the financial system of no matter which country with no stable income. 
Personally I do not suppose that such a suggestion could see the daylight, the disadvantages totally outweighing the benefits. On one hand, it requires a strong financial background of the country in question. On the other hand, this kind of program would appeals to lower classes, which would provoke its boost. 
Finally, as long as financial problems are crucial, people will be inventing a huge range of methods to solve it equally for everyone.
