Nowadays Internet is spread all around the world and you can find anything on the Net. People do not need to go to the cinema to watch the new film and it is unnecessarily to buy tickets to another country just to listen to your favourite musician. Copies started spreading by the Net very quickly. Some people think that those one who download these copies, should be punished, because it's a theft. This essay disagrees that opinion, and there are some reasons below. 
Firstly, the aspect of the opportunity to buy the original discs depends on the country. Some music or film discs are not delievered in certain countries. For Example, in Russia it could be hard to find some original copies of new albums or films, hence, the only way for the huge fans to listen to their favourite musician or to watch the film is to find the pirate copies on the Net. 
Moreover, music, films and other forms of art should be available to anyone. The opportunity of knowing art should not depend on the amount of money which certain person owns and other does not. In my opinion, there could be a measure to definite who is a real pirate, commiting theft, and who just has no other way to enjoy music and films. 
To sum up, I want to say that there is no certain definition for the pirates. It could not be denied that artists, musicians and film makers lose their money, but we cannot define such kind of theft in one way. Some measures should be taken not to make the situation even worse.
