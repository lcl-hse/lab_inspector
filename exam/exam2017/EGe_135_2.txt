Nowadays sport is one of the most important parts in everyday life. People have started do sports more to be healthier and be more in fit. But doing sport by yourself and just watch it on either on TV or at Life are different things. That's why some people believe that it's useless to watch it. 
Personally I agree with this view, beacause there is no effect in the case when you watch sport. Of course you may enjoy watching it on TV,or if it's at live you may go wild or boo in the stadium, especially when you're a fan of sport. But nevertheless it should be like an entertainment, not hobby. It will be better try some kind of sports that you like, than waste time watching it sitting on the sofa. 
On the other hand there are people who can't imagine their day without watching some matches or rings of their favourite team or sportsman. Mostly there are people who are either sportsmen themselves or really fans of sport. Unlike me, they won't support the idea that watching sport events is a waste of time, because it may be seem a part of life for some of them. 
It seems to me, the only competitions that the whole world watch are the Olympyc games or World Cups, they are discussed all over the world. Besides the places to which the sportsmen of different countries reach are playing very significant role for that countries. For the economics, sport life in that countries. 
In the conculison i'd like to mention that every person should do some sport to be in fit, and to feel better. Because now we live in more stressful, sitting and not so healthy lives.
