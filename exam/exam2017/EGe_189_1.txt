The graph below shows us some data about the amount of time people of different gender and age spent on sport and exercise in England in 2012. There are two tipes of columns: for men and for women. We can see, that men of all ages spent more time doing sport than woman but one exception for people from 55 to 64 years old. For them this rule doen not work: the columns are almost same, but women spent a bit more time on exercises, then man did. The greatest amount of time was spent by men from 16 to 24 years and the least by women over 75. The number of minutes spent on doing sport becomes lower when the age grows exept two cases. One of them is two same columns for women from 25 to 34 and from 35 to 44 and the second is the column for men from 65 to 74, which is higher than for men from 55 to 64.
