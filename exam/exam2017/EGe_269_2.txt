It is undeniable that nowadays plains and air travel in general are a big part of our lives. Thousands of people every day use air transport to travel: to visit their family, attend a buisness meeting or to have a vacation somwhere far away from home. 
It is an unfortunate thing, of course, that right now humanity is doing its best to destroy the beautiful planet they inhabit. Every minute the poisonous gas polluts the air, toxic materials are being thrown into the ground and in the water. And even if it seems that the government is trying to do something about the matter, Earth is still suffocating. Is paying money (fines or taxes) for an extra fliht a good thing? Maybe. If it is a plane with a lot of people inside, they can probably afford to pay a little bit more for the tickets. Some individuals own a private jets, there will not be many passengers, but if a person can buy a jet, they can definetely pay a tax. 
But here comes another problem, how can we be sure that the money indeed will be used to fix the problems with the air pollution and global warming? It is not always easy, trusting your government, that is why paying more for the air transportation can cause protests among the population. That a solid argument and a good reason why legal actions (laws etc.) seem to be too radical and shouldn't be written. The people will get rebellious if the government takes something so important and valuable away. 
To sum this up, I would like to state that I consider laws reducing some kinds of air transportation too radical. But I would be pleased if one had to pay some kind of tax for unnecessary use of plains or jets.
