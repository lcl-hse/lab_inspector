In modern years, the vast expansion of big corporations through the globe surges faster and faster, making local businesses less valuable and interesting for the customers. There are some pros and cons of this process, but I am prone to believe, that there are more minuses of it, than pluses. 
On the one hand, we live in the era of consumerism and progress, that is why bigger companies make our lives easier. For example, they provide on-line services, which save a lot of our time. Furthermore, the number of various items is always bigger in multinational brands' shops. 
On the other hand, sometimes local businessmen have the better quality of the products, but no one notices them, because they cannot afford ad. Moreover, they need money to feed their children, and bigger companies almost steel these money. There are also bribes on this market, what makes the situation for the local business even worse. 
To sum up, small businesses need the goverment's help and deserve some support from it. Nevertheless, there is a clear tendency of multinational brands to win this race. That's why such corporations are concidered to be "the Evil".
