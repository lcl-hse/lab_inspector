It is a common opinion that watching sport is not worth our time, which we spend on it. This statement has both sides. 
My belief is that people have to do sport, not just be fans. Firstly, it is really wasting of time to watch it, because it has emerged not as attractive performance, but as way to keep your body in fit. The antient greecs did not discover the Olympic games to entertain the audience. It was the competition, in which you can prove and check yourself. Secondly, people, who are watching sport events in real life or on TV, usually are very "reputable" critics. They just want their favourite team or wgatever to win. But people become very dissapointed, if something goes wrong. In that case we all can give a lot of worth advice while sitting in the sofe. Finally, the question is, why do not you do sport? I suppose that, it is impossible to watch but not to do. How about the motivation and the wish to look like participans of sport events. 
On the other hand, there are a lot of invalid people, who have no opportunity to become a word-known sportsman or simply do it for their pleasure. Due to this fact, watching is a compromise, which can brings they to their dream a bit closer. Moreover, as it was mentioned above, sport is the cause of appearing the myriad of fans. 
They, of course, could do some fitness or play football or whatever. In this case, it is the part of their life, the vital one. So, importance could not be a wasting of time. 
To conclude, the sport is vital part of people's lifes. It gives us a lot of opportunities and improves our phisical and moral health. But the main problem is to manage somehow watching and doing, because if we split them up, sport will continue to be a vital part, however watching may be the cause of a planty of diverse problems.
