Nowadays the problems of air travels and envirinment pollutions, caused by this type of transport, are discussed all over the world. Some poeple are convinced the entitlement of the governments to provide modern laws for reducing of usage of planes for needs of passengers could solve these problems. However, there are some groups which are disagree with this opinion. As for me, I completely agree with the siggested statment, based on increasing of new laws. It could help to dicrease the amount of consumers in air tourism. Futhermore, this decision may lead to necessity of creating of new ways of fuels for plane, wich would not be such insecure, as it was before. 
Initially, it should be said creating of the new code, wich would not exept the public usage of air travels for buisness and leisure needs, could make people think about journey by train insread of plane. It is evident, this type of transerring could be observed as much less harmful for the nature. For example,train could transport more amount of passenger for one time, than plain. Accordingly, it would cause less damage. 
The necessity of refusing from air travels, moreover, may open plemty of new possibilities for humanity in general. If the people had not abilities for utilising of habitual ways of engines, theey would have to invent something new. Scientists, for instance, would have much more stimules for creating modern safety types of fuel. 
In conclusion, it might be observed that making new laws, based on evident rationale, could help to avoid loads of problems today and in the nearest future. I am convinced the suggested decision could change life of the whole planet to the best.
