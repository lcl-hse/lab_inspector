Nowadays, some people think that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally for a limited period of time. Some others think that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. This essay will discuss both points of view.

Such athletes distort people imagination about professional sport and consequently decrease people interest to them.

Another supportive argument, that banning athletes for the rest of their lives we can ensure that those people will stop using druggs. It will cause a decrease of drug expansion between athletes, and it will improove their health condition. 
On the other hand, everybody makes mistakes. We can imagine that athlete in his seek to achievements, ready to try everything to increase his abbilities. In that case, using illegal drugs is the easiest way to achieve your goals. The best way to eliminate athlete's hesitations: to use drugs, or not to use, is a limited time bann. Using this solution for the problem of illegal drugs using, we can ensure that after athletes return to professional competitions, he will never try to improve his skills by using drugs. 
In conclusion we can state, that illegal drugs are absolutely un acceptable in professional sport, and athlets caught using this drugs should be banned, but the period of their bann should depends on the situation.
