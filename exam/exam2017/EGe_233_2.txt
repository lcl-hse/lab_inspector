Some people believe that giving criminals longer prison sentences will reduce the level of crime, others disagree with that opinion. 
On the one hand it is evident why this opinion appeared. People who support it think that, fistly, the longer the prison sentence is, the more people fear to get into prison, and secondly, there will be less criminals on the streets, as most of them will be in prisons for long (or forever). 
On the other hand increasing the length of prison sentences has some disadvantages. To begin with,'longer' compaired to what standard? Every country has its own, and those countries which have the longest prison sentences do not suffer least from the crimes. After that, where to keep all the criminals, what would they eat? Of course, taxes rise automatically, which will lead to a wave of protest in the society. Then, a criminal society is formed in prisons, the longer one stays there, the more of a criminal one becomes. Let us take an example of a crime story, a boy decided to record a movie in the cinema and post it on the internet. After the reform, which makes ALL the prison sentences longer, he might remain in prison not for a couple of years, but for the whole decade. What kind of a person is he going to be after going out? If we increase the penalties only for certain crimes, then how should we choose which ones? So, we can see, that there is a lot to think through in this law. 
It should be stated that there are other ways to reduce crimes. I believe, that the government could make all the prisoners work and thus make prisons profitable. Doing so will not only give some money to the governmental budget, but also give criminals a profession. There may even be a practice of giving the former prisoners work on the factories. 
To sum up, prison sentences should be increased with caution, moreover, in my opinion, other measures should better be taken to reduce crime.
