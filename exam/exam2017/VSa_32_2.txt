The products of innovation came to our lives not so far ago but we already can't imagine our lives without them even despite of some problems which these goods cause to us. It's a very important question how to deal with them because people will unlikely give up the usage of gadgets. 
The most obvrous problem which we gain using electronics are connected with eyes: when we sit in front of the screens for a long time we loose our ability to see well. Also active usag of technological goods may influence on brains and other crucial organs causing, for example heart attack. Several years ago I saw news about how the teenager died after he had been playing computer games a couple of days without a stop. Though, it is an exeptional case ther problems are connected with our possibilities. New technologies make people's live eager, performing their actions for themselves. 
After all, the laziness engines the progress. We not only become dependent on technologies, we tail to perform some actions. As a physical problem it can result in people being fat. Gadgets can't be get away from our lifestyle, people won't allow it. Of course, they play significant and positive role, they just have side effects. Thys people should be able to explane the negative effects of technologies to themselves in different ways - goverments should advertise health and sports, for example, opening new sports courses for people! Parents should control at least the time their children use gadgets. 
To sum up, technologies are unevitable, but they have certain side effects on us and we should be able to prevent them.
