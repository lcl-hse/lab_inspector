The number of teenagers who take part in crimes is getting bigger every year. In this essay I am going to write about the most powerful causes and try to make some suggestions how to deal with this problem. 
First of all, the biggest problem is that children have bad influence from TV shows, computer games and social networks. There are a great number of online and computer games, where you have to grap banks and kill people. Teenagers think that it is a good way to make money with crimes. Moreover, children kill people in computer games and it makes them agressive. About ten years ago, children did not have this opportunity to use computer every day, that is why they spent time with friends outside and play "children games". As a result, these games make them addicted and they want to make crime in a real life. 
Secondly, children have a lot of free time and they start to use internet very early. There are many online websites which force young people make crime. These groups make teenagers agressive and children think that it is normal to do crime for money or for your own reasons. 
It is really difficult problems to be solved. Firstly, children should make sport, it will help them full there free time. Moreover, when you make sport you can find good friends who have the same interests as you are, communicate with them and spend your free time together on different sport competitions. 
Secondly, it is really important not to give computer or any gadgets with internet to young children. Parents and teachers should limit children's using od gadgets, because it is bad for their mind. 
To sum up, the problem of teenagers' crime is important nowdays and adults should explaine young people that it is horrible to make crime.
