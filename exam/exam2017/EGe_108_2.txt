It is no doubt that nowadays, accoridng to the statistic, the most number of all crimes are been done by teenagers. Moreover, this number increase gradually, unfortunatelly. In this essay I try to provide some possible causes of this fact and give some solutions to prevent it in future. 
It is clear from criminal statistics that in most cases of crime, the young people participate in it and there are some causes on it. Some of them grow up in a poor family and they want to get a money. Also, one of the causes may be the environment, where this people grew up. Some scientists claims that it is the most possible causes. For example, wnen one of tne member of family was in prisoner. Another assumption is that the desire to crime is innate and it is in their nurture. 
I can provide some solution, which will be helpful for prevent it. For instance, the young people should have more sport sections. It may be interesting, therefore there are a different opportuinities for competition. Such team sports like football, basletball and etc. Moreover, parents and teachers should pay more attention for teenagers and control them in a good sence. They can suggest to their children and studients read more books. 
In my view,the young people shoud recognise with help of their parents, teachers, books or other resources that do crime is not good for theyselfs and for society in general. The teenagers should have be more busy in his life and in this cases in they head won't be thoughts, connecting with crimes.
