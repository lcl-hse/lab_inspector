The bar chart demonstrates the numbers of billion of dollars being earned by four different countries: USA, Germany, China, UK involved in a book trade. It is clear that the market trade differed on a base of paper and ebook subject and was accounted in number of billions of dollars. 
The largest scale of money was earned by USA in 2014 on a base of a print market: the country achieved 10,5 billions of dollars. In 2018 the USA suffered from loosing about 3 billions of dollars in the print market but, despite this, remained a leader of other three countries. Germany saved the number of billions of dollars received from the print market: the number of earned money - 6 billions of dollars - remained stable both in 2014 and 2018 years. 
The three countries - Germany, China and UK tend to neglect with the use of ebook market in 2014: all three countries got only 1, 0.5 and 1.8 billions of dollars respectively. It is clear that China had the lowest number of earned money in ebook market both in 2014 and 2018: China achieved only 0,5 and 1 billions of dollars.
