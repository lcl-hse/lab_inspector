The diagrams below illustrate the changes in the usage of Facebook between 2012 and 2013 and show the crucial reasons for using it based on gender. 
The general trend is clear: over time, it becomes less convinient for people to use Facebook. Also, the main reasons for using Facebook are sharing photo and video materials, as well as receiving updates and seeing funny posts. 
After taking a closer look, in March 2012 over 140 million of users were using Facebook on their desktops, however, just in one year this number fell to under 60 million. The numbers for mobile devices also fell drastically: from about 140 million in 2012 to less than 100 million in 2013. In terms of reasons for using this social network, 54% of women and 39% of men share photos and videos with it. At the same time, only 35% of female users and 25% of males learn about ways to help others through Facebook. Receiving updates is the equally important reason to use Facebook for 39% of both men and women, but 43% of women like to see funny posts there, compared to 35% of men who like to do the same. 
Overall, Facebook becomes less popular among users, and reasons for using it are slightly different for two genders.
