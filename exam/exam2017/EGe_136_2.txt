In many countries of our morden world there is a tendency of replacing small business by worldspread brands. Although there are drawbacks to such actions, I would argue that these are outweighed by the benefits. The main disadvantage of this tendency is that this process leads to the monopoly of worldwide brands that dictete thier own terms. Customers are not only limited with selections of a variety of goods, they are also have to pay the price that have been set by there brands. Moreover, these actions are completely unprofitable for economy of a country and slows down the process of globalization and global economy. That means that countries that have market economy could not exist with the monopoly and it can lead to the destruction of the political system. 
As for profits, such global companies are well-known and give a gerentee for their goods. Customers are considered to prefer the brands that are very common, so as not to risk. 
To sum it all up, overall I do believe that the drawbacks are greater than the benefits. The process of replacing small business can lead to monopoly and destruction of the market system.
