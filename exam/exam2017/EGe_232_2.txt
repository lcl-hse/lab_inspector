Nowadays air travel is one of the most popular tipe of trasportation. People prefer air machines because it is seems more safe and comfortable. But this transport becomes one of the main reason of the global warming and air pollutions. 
Some people believe that the air tranports is one of the easiest way to achieve the country, where you would like to be. It is can save a lot of people time, because this kind of transport But, the another point of view is that air travel is not cheap and it is used by only rich people. Moreover, there are the air craches, in which died a lot of people. That is why there is an opinion that the goverments should use the air transports as little as they can. There are a lot of another tipes of transportation: cars, trains, diffrent machines. 
As far as I am concernd, the air travel is not good enouth today. There are usually no chances to stay alive in air craches. 
However, all the transport in the world is unsafe. The air machines give people a lot of chances of transportation big things, what cannot do the cars or trains. There are so many unstubilish machines: sometimes details in their constractions cannot save people's live. Moreover, car craches happends vastly often. In conclutions I would like to say that people shoud spend more time on the new tecnologies of transport to make it more safer and to solve these crash problems. Then the air travel would not be the reason of air pollution.
