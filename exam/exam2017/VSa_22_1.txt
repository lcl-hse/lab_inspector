Both diagrams illustrate proportions of different goods, transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. Overall, the main type of goods, distributed by rail in the considered year, is metals, while for road it is food products. 
To start with, it can be seen from the chart that nearly one quater of all products transported both by rail and by road was manufactured ones. For other types of goods there is a different proportion in every chart. The most substencial difference is in the transported metals: they share 35% in rail transportation of goods, compared with only 11% in the one of the road. Another stricking feature of the diagrams is that proportion of machinery, distributed by rail, is sixfold bigger than the per cent of the same product, transported by road. 
In conclusion, the shares of manufactured goods in transportation are equal for both road and rail distribution, while proportions of other goods varied significantly.
