Some people believe that rise of using modern technology causes the increasing number of health problems. 
Actually, there is a number of reasons for this issue. First and foremost, it is clearly, that every single person living in a modern realities has his or her own smartphone. Nowadays scientists strongly believe that mobile phones can make a huge damage to human's heath-rhythm and eyesight. Secondly, logisty say that a permanent opportunity to get any kind of information you want causes many problems. For example with nerves and human's phsychology in general. Another major reason is the fact that the level of traffic in modern cities is highly increased. This causes air pollution, which is also destroying for human's health. Some researches say that nowadays ozone layer is already damaged so much, that we can't even recover it. 
Nevertheless, there are some ways humanity could use to resolve these issues. Firstly, we can rearrange transporting use as more environmentally-friendly. For example, international transportations could make their transporting by using electric transport. Trains nowadays are as fast as cars or ships. This kind of transport is not wedespreaded because of the borders and the laws. I guess, governments should think about ecology and open borders for the international railway connection. Another thing that can be done to reduce technology damage on our health is try to face less mobile phone or a computer in your everyday life. You might use your phone only for connecting people and a compute only for work issues, for instance. 
To summarise, I would like to say that influence of widespread technology on our health is not just technologies imperfectane fault. Personally, I think that it is our own choise. To ger pleasure and comfort by using our gadgets and have some problems with health or to have a great healthy body, but say 'no' to using technologies for your pleasure. Everything has it's worth and it is up to you to decide.
