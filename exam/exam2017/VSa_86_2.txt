The use of illegal drugs in sport is becoming more widespread nowadays. There are several opinions on this matter. Some people think, that athlets should be banned from competitions for a limited period, while others think, that this punishment should endure for the rest of their lives. 
The first ones, those who mention a limited period, certainly have some solid ground arguments. Of course, as humanity develops, develops sport industry as well. New sport equipment, new training methods can sometimes allow even things that may have been called a miracle the last century. And, no doubt, it's becoming more difficult to achieve new records. This provides illegal drugs usage. And it is very difficult, perhaps, even impossible to determine, whether it was a sportsman's desire, or a government pressing. It is indeed rather strange thing, but archaical wish to show country's musculinum, glory and power even throw sport competition still lives! So, often, it may indeed be not a desire of sportsmen to use illegal drugs, but opression by the government forces. 
Others, evidently, do not assume that it is possible and demand wronged sportsmen to be banned for the rest of their lives. This point of view may be understanded. Because unfairness is indeed a sad problem. And it should be punished. 
But from my point of view, there cannot be a simple yes or no decision. Every crime is unique. And as I mentioned afterwards of some powerfull structures interference. 
To conclude, I would like to underline one more time emphasis of principle, that every evidence is unique and should be judged very carefully.
