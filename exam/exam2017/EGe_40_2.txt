Nowadays rates of crime by young people are increasing unexpectedly. The government as well as parents and teachers try to find solutions in order to tackle this problem. Some people claim that punishment is the best way to control the number of crimes. But what are the causes of this development and how parents and teachers can help to solve this issue? That are the key question. 
First of all, without any doubt there is an increse in robber,murder crimes among young people and this can be caused by the lack of attention. Parents should pay more attention to their children and they should not forget about talking about their problems. Parents are very important people for every person so children should not be lonely and they should feel the support. 
The second problem is that young people cannot enter the University after school and there are a lot of people from poor famulies so they have to break the law in order to earn some money. In order to solve this problem teachers should do all their best for helping young people in education and becoming good people. 
It is not a secret that crime is shown everywhere: in TV shows, in different movies and even in cartoons. So this is a great problem as children can be influenced by it. So another possible approach would be for the Government to ban such movies. 
In conclusin,it is true taht this propblem will probably not be solved very quickly. But it is not a reason to avoid taking actions. It is up to us and everything is in our hands.
