The question of crime has disturbed humanity all along it's history. Philosophy and religion have been discusing if crime can be linked to sin, while politisians have tried different ways of dealing with it, starting with simply killing the criminal and than inventing different system of prisons. 
Not so long ago the question of death sentence was debated furiosly, but nowadays execution looks like attrocity to most people. It brings us to the question of efficiancy of prisons. As soon as they are our own solution, they ought to be helpful, aren't they? 
Prisons of Western world are tend to becoming more and more comfortable, providing prisoners television, books, some mind-occupaing work to do, good food and comfortable sleeping place. Critics argue that prisoners' conditions are too good, as they are living on citizens' taxes sometimes better than those citizens themselves. Can this hotel-like system be considered a punishement that leads to redemption? Some say that prison sentence must be as long as possible to force prisoners to otherthinking their behavior and evil deeds in such comfy conditions. They believe that the fear of long enough sentence will prevent people from commiting crimes as the risk will be not worth it. 
But such people are not looking at the core. They do not consider reasons that push people to crime. Most in prison are sentenced for robbery, drugs, domestic violence. All these crimes are caused mainly by poor economical and social conditions. It is very convinient for politisans to accuse poor people and portray them as maniacs who threaten wealthy middle class. I do believe that the best way to prevent crime is to work on people's level of life, spend more many not on army but on education and social serveses that can help people in crisis.
