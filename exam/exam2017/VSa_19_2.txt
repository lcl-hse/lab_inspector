In the modern world there are many ideas about the using of modern technology in the medicine. Let us start from рассмотрения these technologies in the details. 
Firstly, I would like to say that there many health problems which we can вылечить with using modern technology. For example, a broken hand, foot or sheaf also you can use of modern technology for the лечения зубов. It is important that some new technology we can see only in the best hospitals, аптеках but in some villiges there are not them. People from small towns or villiges get to the centre, in their city with their problems. They get to the good with серьезными health problems only. For example, when a person has ill heart, or some болезни which несовместимы with life. 
Secondly, I believe that the modern technology can give to people a second шанс to live a whole life, for instance, a person without a foot or hand can new конечность which will be do from some new matirials. Some hospitals use laser... 
In conclusion, the modern world do get a new step in the treatment. Today many people have opportunities to do better their health with some new technologies.
