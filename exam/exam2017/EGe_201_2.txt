All of the large and powerful countries want to become number one in space exploration. To prove this it is enough to remember about space race between USA and USSR during The Cold War in the 20th century. However, space exploration asks for a lot of money. Many people think that, probably, it would be better to spend this money for more everyday problems. 
In my opinion, goverments should put urgent problems first and pay much more attention to them than to space exploration. First of all, goverments need to look after theis citizens, not after stars. They must build new roads, improve hospitals and educational system. If countries have money for spaceships but do not have good level of life, it is bad goverment. Stars are wonderful but millions people in the world live in poverty and cannot afford even their own home. Society problems should be solved before space exploration because spaceships and colonies on Mars would not be needed by anyone, if there are dying citizens who cannot affort healthcare. 
Secondly, space exploration has no practical aim now. It is only science. It cannot improve or change life of counties. If so, why would goverment waste citizens' money for this? For example, International Space Station is a great project but it means nothing to everyday life. Some of money should be spent for space but only for support of science. At the same time it seems like for many countries space exploration is a question of death and life. This fact is weird because it does not solve problems and would not in many years. 
In conclusion, developing of science is important part of budgets. However, this part should not be made by cutting other parts, which are more crucial for society. There are poverty and many poor-educated people in the world. Probably, they should be helped and saved first. Spaceships can wait.
