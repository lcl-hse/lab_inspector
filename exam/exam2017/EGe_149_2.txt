We all know that in our modern world the level of crime made by people under age of 25 has highly increased. Why did this happen? What are the ways to make lower the level of crime among teenagers? 
First of all, we need to know why did the level of crime boost up. Personally I think, that currently there are lots of homeless children or children who's parents are not interested in their children's life. Furthermore, in the majority of suburbs, sush as so-called "hood", we can see people who are at the edge of poorness, they do not work at all. for them it is easier to go and rob the bank or some wealthy houses. This people do not go even to schools, I am not talking about colleges. Talking about one more reason, nowadays we have a high level of dealing drugs, in some places we can see kids selling, or what is worse, buying drugs. That can be a strong cause to. 
Second of all, what the parents need to do is keep an eye open on their children. And I am not talking about spying, no, but every mother or father needs to know with whom their son or daughter is a friend, where do their friends live. Although, it would be great to ask our child some questions. For example, where are you meeting with your friends? Do you want me to drive ypu there? How was your day? What is new? 
To conclude, parents need to maintain the connection between them and their children. The society, including the government, needs to help poor families, needs to provide teenagers in ghettos and hoods education and teach them some jurasical laws. Furthermore, we need to clean our streets from drugs and gangs.
