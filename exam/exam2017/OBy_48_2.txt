Nowadays many people maintain that the worldwide usage of modern technology affects people's health in a negative way: causing a number of problems. 
Obviously, there are a lot of diseases caused by computer technologies deeply involved in our lives. These technologies might have a bad impact on a person's eyes, heart, quality of sleep and a number of other organs and vital processes. On the one hand, such difficulties could be solved by prohibiting the computer technologies in everyday life (banning the production of Bluetooth-supporting lightning, doors and pots). Moreover, using computers and digital screens for the learning process could be banned too. However, such a solution might stop the technological progress and make our lives less comfortable. 
So, on the other hand, the technology might be accepted and considered as a part of modern everyday life and made more eco-friendly. That could be reached by using solar energy and demonstrate all the data on a retina-screen, which is less harmful for eyes. Nevertheless, it is impossible to reconstruct all the aspects of our modern life without using as much technology as today, so it would be much easier to make technology more healthy, and at the same time continue to develop its technical characteristics. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that the widespread use of modern technology has a huge disadvantages which is affecting the users' health in a harmful way, however, there is a variety of disputable solutions of this problem that could be taken into consideration by ordinary people and by huge concerns managins the rechines production as well.
