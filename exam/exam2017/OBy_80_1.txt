The pie charts represent two ways of transportation in the area of Eastern Europe. We can see big difference between the amount of some goods. Otherwise there are goods which are transported by rail and road with the same parts. That is why we can permanently check, that by rail are mostly transported metals. But transportation by road, metals are not so popular. In comparison we can see that manufactured goods and food products are two mainly transported good by road. If we make a comparison betwee two ways of transportation, we will observe that transporting machinery by rail is bigger in six times. By the way, the amount of manufactured goods are the approximately the same. Chemicals being transporting by rail are a little bit smaller that transporting by road. Non-metallic minerals do not consist great part of the transportation in Eastern Europe, but they also keep to be about ten per cent. 
In conclusion I would like to say that ways of transporting different goods help people to have them in all parts of the world.
