The bar chart provides information about amount of time spent doing the different kinds of sport exercise in England amoung man and woman in 2012. 
Overall, teenagers spent more their time on sport than adults approximately 2 times. The average time which they do sport is 200 minuts togetger man and woman. However, the gender has an influence on the average time spent. If we look at the bar chart, we can see that man spent significally more time on sport exercises than woman and young girl. For example, from 45 to 54 years woman spent about 70 minuts on sport, while man are doing sport in 2 times more. 
As may be concluded from the chart, with the age people spent less their time on sport and to 75 years old they nearly ended doing the exercises. In 75 years old man spent only around 29 minuts on sport, while woman spent a way over this amount, 10 minuts. The average time spent amoung adults people is about 110 and 100 minuts in period of a lifetime 35-44 and 45-54 respectively. 
I guess, this statistics is really plausible. Undoubtedly, the age of a person has influence on the possibility doing the sport exercises.
