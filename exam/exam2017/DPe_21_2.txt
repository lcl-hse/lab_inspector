IIlegal coping and sharing different media files continue to be quite controversial issue. There is extremely popular belief that these actions sould be punished because of financial loses of creators. I partly agree with this statement. This essay illustrates different point of view on this problem. 
One of the most convincing argument in favour of necessarity of punishment for making and sharing illegal pirates copies is the fact that these actions are not fair and honest. Most people are aware of that musicians and filmmakers get a huge part of profits from selling records of their songs, alboms, films - results of working hard, that are expected to be paid. Therefore, it is complicated to avoid a question: why a person, who does not pay in a store for products is a thief, but a men, who listens a new hit of a rockgroup at home for free is just a fan? It seems quite unfair in the centure of democracy. 
Nevertheless, it is worth remembering about the initial role of music and art of creating films in lives of people. Factually, masters work not for money, but for transferring their feelings, emotions, ideas to hearts, minds and soules of spectaculars and listeners. Naturally, music, films and other gonres of art were allowed for everyone who wished it. It was a common pleasure independent on the size of the wallet. In today's world this law is unlikely to be followed, and it is rather upset. 
Taking everything into consideration, it can be concluded that the best way to address this issue of pirates copies is to find golden middle between punishments and common wishes to love music and films.
