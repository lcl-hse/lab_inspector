Nowadays there exists a controversial problem connected with international sports. This problem is the consumption of illegal medicine which is expanding in the whole world. There are the different points of view: some people think that athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from sport only for a limited time, while others think that they should be excluded from competing forever. In my essay I will discuss both views and give my own opinion. 
I think that a lifetime ban for professional athletes who were caught using illegal drugs may have some negative sides. At first, even modern procedures of analysis can cause mistakes. If a sportsman or a sportswoman is caught on something that he/she didn't do, it will be totally unfair. Such mishap might ruin one's career or even life. At second, the problem of choosing which drugs are legal and which are not is controversial itself. For example, an athlete can use drugs, which are get not illegal. The next day or week this drug is proclaimed illegal. What is he/she going to do? So, a severe punishment can be extremely unfair. 
This is the reason why many people say that athletes should be banned only for a restricted period of time. I think that this view is far more fair and conscious. If an athlete is caught on using illegal drugs, he/she can have time to think about this problem. If an athlete is eager to return to professional competition, he/she will never use these drugs in future. 
As for me, I think that a strict punishment is not necessary. I agree withe the second point of view. If an athlete doesn't want to return to sport, he can do it.
