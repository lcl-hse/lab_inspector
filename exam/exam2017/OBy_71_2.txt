Nowdays, some people think, that health problems exist thanks using of modern technology. 
I agree with this point of view because the modern technology damage our environment, for example air, ocean, lackes and other. For instance, some peoples have sickness like astma or epelepsy. Also, many factories located near the hometown, near the buildings, where people lives and works. Moreover, junk, which all people and many different factories have, damage oceans, rivers, forests, and it is cause, why many people have many king of problem with their health, and, also, many organisms and animals died. For example, some kind of fish died because river where they lived, was damage by junk. 
Moreover, thank to junk, new parasits and paste born in this junk, what lead to huge problems, for example, it lead to born some dangerous sickness. 
I think, what this problem have a few ways for decide. The first ways is produse some things (for example, dangerous details for car) in space or some planet, where do not live people. Also, junk should be reuse, for example, like paper or plastic.
