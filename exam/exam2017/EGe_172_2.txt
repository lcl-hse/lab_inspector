Everybody likes watching films. And it is common knowledge that people all over the world prefer watching British or American films to their local films. Should we blame governments for not giving money to local film industries? 
We all know that films that are made in Britain or America are more popular than films that are made in other countries. There are several reasons why people prefer them to locally produced ones. Of course British and American films have huge financial support, not only from governmets, but also just from rich people who are intersted in them. However, first of all, these films are really well made and they have interesting plot. Secondly, British amd American films always have impressive visual effects, people like them. Thirdly, the most well known directors are from Britain and America, that is why people will like their films even if they are not so good. The reason is the perfect reputation of these directors. 
Finally, Britain and America are very developed countries, people from other countries always want to follow them. And they can admire British or American lifestyle through the screen. 
However, some people are sure that financial support from governments can make any local movie better. They think that all the visual effects can be made using special expensive programes. To their mind, there is no need in talent to make great movies. Money would be enough to create a masterpies.
