It is known that the use of computers, mobile phones and other modern gadgets could be damaging for our health. It is a warrying trend since it results in severe problems with our eyes, weight and so on. 
The increased these health problems we are witnessing today could be caused by a number of reasons. First of all, because sometimes we spend too much time sitting with our iphones or laptops, which leads to pout seeing. Secondly, modern population by more vehicles, move and walk less and finally put on weight, which consequently leads to some heart problems. Another important factor is air pollution, caused by increasing number of vehicles, especially in big cities. Air pollution affect negatively on our respiratory sistem. And what makes things worse is that nobody can do anything with this problem. If we live in urban area we can't stop breath this air. 
What is needed to improve the situation is a definite action. Our daily life needed to be improved. We should know more about time management and restrict time we're spending with every type of modern gadget. Other measures could include eating healthy food, doing more fisical activities and spending more time outside the home, or what is better outside the urban area. Another obvious solution is to encourage people to co-operate and share one vehicle with other people. In that way we can deal with air pollution or minimize it. 
To summarize, I believe that the effects of modern technology on people's health is too serious to ignore. Some measures have to be taken soon, otherwise the environment and our health will be at great risk.
