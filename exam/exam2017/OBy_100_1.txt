The bar diagram provides changes in the unemployment rate in selected world regions in period between 2014 to 2015. 
As we can see from the chart the result in different region not the same. N.Africa unemployment rate is remain constant in 12,5%, but in the Middle East bar illustrates some changes, bar goes down for 1,4%. It's a slowly decrease. In Europe bar represents a little bit drawing only for 0,4%. Latin America has the same trend like the Middle East, it falls for 3%. S.Asia leveles off the persent of unemployment rate is 3,9%. The worldwide has the same sitiation, bar remains steady from 2014 to 2015 and percent is similary 5,9%. 
Finally, I'd like to make a conclusion of this chart after analizabed that bar we can see: first of all, in 3 regions unemployment rate didn't change and levels off two regions have small difference and only one region has growing up.
