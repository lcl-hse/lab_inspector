It is no of an exaggeration that questions of up-bringing have always been crucial and mind-boggling. It is claimed that in the modern world more and nore adolescents are getting involved into criminal environment. To my mind, this issue is rather controversial. 
As for increasing numbers of young criminals, I would not be that exact, because I assume that statistics can be obsinetely flawed in order to meet the demands of companies who have their vested interest in this issue. Moreover, crime has been existing since the very beginning of our history and it has been closely connected to the pecularities of the century and traditions of a particular country, that is why it is not easy to comment on the rates of criminal cases. Still, it would be silly to neglect this problem. There are dozens of factors that may provoke such a problem starting with violence on the TV, psychological issues, tense conditions within the family and eding with official laws that approve carriage of weapons. 
Obiusly, parents and teachers that deal with youngsters are the first to help them out. Some of them choose to err on the side of caution and leave them alone with their troubles. Notwithstanding, probably the best sollution is to talk to them. It may ineed sound ubiquitous and inconvincing but the outcomes will be bewildering. 
All in all, young people are to be helped and guided untill it is too late to talk to them in a friendly way and it is also the responsibilit of the society to provide acceptable conditions for their growth.
