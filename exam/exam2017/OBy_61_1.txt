We can see two nice schemes on the list with clear round form. People mostly choose a circle then we ask them about 'sexy shape', and it's a reason why we looking at them and getting esthetic happiness. Do we look on the information on graphs? Oh no, we just like these geometric patterns in forms and white space around circle. Its like a new planet in the nowhere; like ours wishes on the black strong matery behind the human death. Goodsm that transporting towards clear air around our 3 meters spaces the ground. 
There's a metals for example. It's our holy money with boring parallel lines pulse our heart then we see cash. By rail we lost 35% money, its bigger then by road because RZD needs more capital for new any politics dacha for example. In the road move chemicals then in rail because drugs an auto in auto is American classic. But just see on food products. We less ear in rail, because 'doshirak' isn't food. 
If we compare charts, we see that important is one thing and it's a colorfull patterns. No matter, what human prefer - rail or road, metals of food. Untill we have a big white space around it and view of any person, these deathers for foolish, who cant the the whole system.
