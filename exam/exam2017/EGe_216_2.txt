Nowadays there is a widespread debate: a gorernment needs follow for people do less air trips or it will be a mistake. We cannot but mention that air is in a dangerous because plans hurt our atmosphere. 
Some people suppose that the air trips follow to air pollution and global warming but the atmoshere should be saved and so the government should reduce all flights. First of all, such pollution can call a lot of deyings of birds. It can be seen by an example of a reseurch project about natural life which was writted by sociologist Tomas Korn from United Kingdom at the beginning of 21 centure. In accordind this work, more birds are died than in the past and one of the major causes is pollution of airs. The difference between our century and 20 century is more than 35% that is very sad. More than that, the pollution of air do begger an ozon crow and it is a cause of global warming and so it is very important process and habitants can away a help in this situation only from government. 
On the other hand, there is opinion that the cause of such pollution is not only plans but also fabrics because they create a lot of bad gases. They say that the good example is the best sermon and so it can be showed on the big (in the 20 century) fabric which locates in Dzerzinsk and it is name is Corund. This building has a very big influence on air and so Dzerzinsk became one of the unclearest towns of Russia and took the second place in this rate. Moreover, cars and bus do more pollution than the plans and so the road kinds of transport are worse than the plans. 
Thus, I partly agree with this position. Although, the air trips has a negative effect on the atmosphere, cars, bus and fabrics have to considered first.
