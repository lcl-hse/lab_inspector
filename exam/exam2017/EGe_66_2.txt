It is widely known that the rate of crimes committed by adolescents is higher than ever before. Therefore there is an urgent need to counteract juvenile delinquency. The aim of the essay is to look into the possible causes of this problem and consider the measures which could be taken to solve it. 
First of all, violence is propagated in numerous films and TV shows. Teenagers watching TV series depicting crime often get the impression that it is is an acceptable way of earning money and becoming successful. For this reason, I believe that discussing such films and TV programmes at school will help to change young people's attitude to this issue. Personally, I remember a round table discussion at school concerning a detective series of dubious quality, and all the students agreed that it should be banned because of the nagative values promoted in it. 
Secondly, there is an infinite variety of computer games which involve fighting or killing. Some adolescents adopt a wrong bahaviour pattern while playing such games and become more aggressive. As a result, there are more murders carried out by youngsters. To my mind, parents should put a restriction on such games and encourage their children to acquire other hobbies, such as sports. 
Another contributing factor to the high number of law violations by teenagers is unemployment. Some youngsters fail to find themselves a proper job and, consequently, tend to compensate for their shortage of money by shoplifting or even burglaring. That is why parents should be more helpful to their children in terms of their financial problems, and teachers should pay greater attention to explaining laws and regulations to their students. 
To conclude, there are a number of factors due to which adolescents engage in illegal activities. However,there is a range of strategies to reduce crime rate among young people, and it is parents' and teachers' duty to implement them.
