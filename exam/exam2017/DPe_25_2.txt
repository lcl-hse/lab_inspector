Nowadays, the problems of illegal pirate work such as making copies of musicians and films products become more important from day to day. Every year new rules, that are connected with art, appear and become more strict. As you can see, a lot of websites that showed film for free or allowed music to download are blocked or deleted. 
In my opinion, it is illegal to spread copies of films and music for free, because it was someone's work, that must be payed for. For example, if speaking about music - people want to listen what they love, so that singers make a records for sell. If you want it, you can go and buy, but, sure, there are people, who think that it is not worth it, because of this they make copies and spread it. I do not think, that people who download these files should be punished, only 'pirates' deserve to be punished. 
First of all, some discs are rare or just left from the magazine, even cannot be sold in some regions, but demand still exists or some disks can be bought only on the consert that is far away from your home. If people cannot find legal way to get disk, 'theaves' allow them to download it from the internet - easiest way to get what you want. Yes, 'buyers' do not pay for it and musicians and film producers lose huge amount of money, but in this case, people do not have another choice. 
Secondly, some versions of music of films do not exist for every technic firm. Sure, Apple and iTunes allow their users to do everything by rules - just click and buy, but some others - do not. For example, you have Sony player, and you cannot legally buy music, only download from free sites is available. 
No questions, that people, who copy products of art should be punished or blocked, but, moreover, if you look at this situation from another side; producer should think about every customer, not only rich one.
