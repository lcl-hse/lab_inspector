The charts illustrate the number of transported goods in european countries during 2008. There are two charts that gives us information about transportation by rail and by road. 
As can be seen from the graph, the biggest amount of goods transported by rail is metals, which is different in products transported by road. This number reveals that the metals delivered by auto transport is only 11 per cent, while railway transport is almost three times more than this amount. The food products transported by road is approximately one third of all goods, whereas the percentage of this goods in railway deliverly is only 11 per cent. There is almost no difference between manufactured products in both of the diagrams, which is around 25 per cent. The machinery products transported by rail are six times bigger than the same goods deliverly by road, which is only 2 per cent. The proportion of chemicals in both charts is almost the same that is 11 % in rail transport and 16 % in the number of goods delivered by road. The charts also show us the amount of non-metallic minerals, which is 13 per cent in road transportation and approximately half of that number in railway deliverly. 
To sum up, there are some common issues in both of the diarams, but as can be seen from the charts, the railway deliverly is more reliable in transporting the heavier goods, than road transportation.
