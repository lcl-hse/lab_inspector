Governments always tend to help citizens, as far as it is important that people have positive attitude to leaders of the country. One of the ideas, which is suggested is a system called "Guaranteed Basic Income". The idea of this system is that there is a monthly payment for people even if they get salary. Now I would like to elaborate on this topic and discuss advantages and disadvantages of this system. 
On one hand, there is a real help for people, who have a lack of money, whatever problem causes this situation. I suppose, it is important to help people, who cannot afford buying even some basic and essential things. For example, there are families with many children, who need to be feed and have clothes to wear but their income is not high enough. What is more, disabled person cannot work well because of his or her disability but he or she still needs to buy food, medicines and some other stuff. 
On the other hand, many people can be so lazy, that they will be happy to have small amount of money, but to be able to stay at home and do nothing. In my view, this can be not only bad for the person, who prefers this lifestyle, but also for the whole society. 
To sum up, the system "Guaranteed Basic Income" is controversial because of the question, if everyone really deserves this monthly payment. In my oppinion, there should be more details about this system, which allow to pay money not for everyone, because sometimes it can become a waste of money for government.
