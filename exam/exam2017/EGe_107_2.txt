We often hear from the news about crimes which are committed by youngsters today. Why did the crime rates increase so sharply and who is responsidle for such behavior? In this essay I will provide some causes and solutions for this problem. 
First of all, it is obvious that with the development of technologies and the Internet not only children became obsessed with it but also their parents. For this reason, they pay less attention to the upbringing and education. Children want to be recognised and want care and love, that is why they choose such radical ways to be in the center of attention. However, there is an easy solution for parents - simply to spend more time with their kids, to prove them their love and to be interested in the live of a child. 
Secondly, the problem may be caused by school life and the relationships with teachers. At some schools students are not allowed to think and act independently, they are put into the straight borders. Phycologists believe that people of this age group are more likely to be sensitive and imposed to mood changes. If they are offended they let an anger to drive them. The possible solution for this is to give children more tasks and games connected with art, emotions, physical activity, focused on the improvement of critical thinking and self-confidence. 
All things considered, never before had the children been so violent and likely to do illegal actions. People can argue infinetly about the causes but the one who cares about kids and loves them will never get an evil back.
