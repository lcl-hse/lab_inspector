Nowadays we live in the world which is full of extraordinary technologies. The Internet is expanding so that people all over the world have the access to the information. In that case it is practically impossible to imagine our word wide net without illigal content. The speed of spreading of some brand new movies or music could be compared with the speed of light, especially if we talk about spreading in social net works. 
On the one hand, these information leaks can be really dangerous on finances for producers. Moreover, the process of filming or recording music is very expensive. Some experts suggest that losses from pirates increasing twice annually. Ordinary people find it easier to find interesting films on the Internet than to go out and watch it on the full screen. Because of it movie producers lose their income. After all, creating movies has become a non-profit process. 
On the other hand, there are a lot of more pros than cons from illegal information spreading and leaks for musicians. The main point is that: if people do not have to pay for music they want to listen to, then they will download and share it with their friends. Firstly, if they like this music, they will buy tickets for the bands sigs, or pay for officiall copies (on iTunes or CDs). All in all we see that if something is for free, more people will listen it. In this ease some musicians post their new albums or songs absolutely for free. The best example is Radiohead. They just let their fans pay as much as they want (or nothing at all) for the new album. 
In conclusion, the pirate problem can be obviously stated as a controvercial one. However, it seem to me that in the nearest future all information will be accessed for free without punishing people who want to be free-riders.
