The chart illustrates differences between print and eBook market in four countries: the USA, Germany, China and the UK. The data covers two periods: 2014th and 2018th, measuring in billions US dollars. 
The highest amount of printing production as well as eBook production in the USA in 2014 (10,5 and 5,5 respectively). On the other hand, the smallest market in 2014 was presented by the UK, whose printing production is valued as 2,6 billions and China, where eBook marked was only 0,5 billions. In Germany different pattern can be seen: there these two markets used to vary significantly, with printing costing 6 billions and eBook market 6 times less. 
Overall, due to the forecast for 2018, eBook market is going to become more popular: in the USA it is predicted to grow up to 8,5 billions of annual profit, while in Germany and China it will rise to 0,5 billions and become 1,5 and 1 billions respectively. It is also instructive to note that, unlike in other countries, in the UK the two markets in both 2014 and 2018 do not differenciate so sharply, with the average differences of no more than 1 billion.
