The bar chart below demonstrates the data about two types of books production in 2014 and predictable changes by 2018 for four countries. It is obvious, that in general, printed books outnumbered electronic ones. 
First of all, printed books were much more popular in 2014 for the vast majority of countries. By the way, USA spent the largest number of money for books in print (10,5 billion US dollars). The exception is Germany, where the same amount of money was spent on print and eBooks'(6 billion). 
Secondly, there is a phenomenon in increasing electronic books market by 2018. Every country expects that e-Books will rocket in four years. However, China and Germany predict a slight growth of only a half billion US dollars. Whereas, the figure of nonprinted books in USA is going to soar at 8,5 billion dollars by 2018. 
To sum everything up, in 2014 the number of printed books outweigh the quantity of electronic ones, but in the nearest future the situation tends to be changed.
