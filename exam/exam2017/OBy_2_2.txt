I'm of the opinion that sharing films and music on the internet for downloading is normal thing nowadays. Now some online-cinemas found the way to make it legal and free - by advertising promotion. 
Firstly, I want to tell you that musicians and producers can earn money by other ways (for example, it can be concerts or permission for rent movies). Secondly, I think that this is important thing for promotion of person - to make free music or films. It is significantly for producers, musicians, directors and different similar professions - to make self name, to state famous in the world. Finally, it can be difficult to buy original products in most cities and towns in Russia (for example). I always show "The Simpsons" by pirate site, but in Russia we have no original movie discs and official translate in our language. We have no way to buy official version! 
In conclusion, I want to tell you that it's not bad thing and most producers are not lose a lot of money by illegal pirate copies. They can make their money by other ways, and they do it! I know about "Hardcore Henry" film, producers of this movie got 14 millions of dollars, they earn these money only by permission for rent film in Russia and USA (10 millions!). So we see that pirate copies are not influence to huge money.
