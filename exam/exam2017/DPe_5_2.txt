Nowadays it is possible to download music and films from the internet without any payment. This leads to the fact that the right owners does not get income from their work. It is considered, the copywriting should be baned and all the attempts to share film or music should be punished. In my view, the government must take measures for preventing of illegal copies. 
Music and films are the same product for sale as gadgets or food. The authors of music and film directors spend their working hours to create a new song or to shoot a new film. That is the the reason why they have all rights to make revenue and get money from their job. It is wrong to make the results of their hard work available for everybody. 
Looking at the another side of this issue, the internet users are not blamed that they have the opportunity to download something for free. Many of them have low salaries and they could not afford to buy legal version or CD disk. 
The government should introduce low prices for downloading music and films. So the demand of such products won't decrease and the right owners get their reward. It is usefull to introduce low taxes for researching the Internet and give transfers to musicians and film producers. It can become convenient for sellers and customers in music and film undustry.
