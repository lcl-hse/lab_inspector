The chart represents the data that concerns the percentage of prison population among white and non-white races. In the USA and the UK there are contrary tendencies. 
Generally, in the UK the ethnic background is considered to be an impportant characteristic. The vast majority of population are white people while less than 15 percent of people are of other races. What is more, nearly three fourth of people who can be called as "white" were imprisoned. However, for non-white part of the population this figure is much less - 26 percents. 
By and large, the society in the USA is a bit more homogenious. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the population are still people belonging to white race. But, the rates of imprisoned citizens are higher for so-called "non-white" race which compound 67 percent. 
Taking the information into account, it is important to emphasize that both in the USA and the UK white part of the population prevailed over non-white one. However, the levels of crime (in accordance with the ethnic background) differs greatly.
