We can see the chart that present to us the information about development of the book market in four countries: the USA, Germany, China and the UK. We can say that USA spends a lot of money on printing and making ebooks, more than other three countries. The forecast says that total amount of books will not change by the year 2018, but the number of printed books will fall down. In Germany the tendency to print books will not change in future, Still 6 billion will be spend on it. However, the number of e-books will grow, but not so much as in the USA. Changes in China will not also be so huge: a little fall in printing books and a half billion increase in ebooks. In the UK the number of ebooks will beat the number of printing books by the year 2018, but it will not make a huge difference, just a 300 million dollars. 
So, we can say that the number of ebooks is going to grow. Not surprisingly that someday in the future people will not print books at all.
