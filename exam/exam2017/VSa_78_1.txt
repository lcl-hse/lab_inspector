The bar chart illustrates the proportion of money spent on printed and E-books relatively in USA, Germany, China and United Kingdom in 2014 and gives a prediction of the change in these figures. Overall, there is an obvious downward trend in all four countries concerning both paper and digital items. 
Regarding the data of 2014, it must be noted print market was more successful in four cases. It reached the biggest popularity in USA rising up to 10,5 billion dollars, whereas England demonstrated the lowest rate for this section, accounting only 2,6 billion dollars. E-book production was of a very small scope in China (only 0,5 billion dollars), Germany and UK had proximate figures, however, US e-book industry was also rather productive. 
Turning to the forecast performed, one may assume that print book production will experience a significant fall in the USA. Nonetheless, figures for this section in other three countries will not change drastically, remaining approximately at the same level. The level of money spent on e-books will rise in all the countries presented hitting a peak in the USA at 8,5 billion dollars.
