Nowadays, it is very popular to download copuing and sharing music and films. Because of it musicians and film producers donot get their money. Some people think that people who do it must be punished. In the same time there is another point of view. 
As for me, I cannot agree that such people should be punished. In our modern world it is much easier to download files than buy the original discs. For example, all people now use Internet. They simply can do two clicks and get the needed things. The next reason is money. Some people, especially children and students, cannot afford to buy the original discs. He or she should not be punished only for lack of money. If somebody really loves musics and films nothing will stop him. 
However, most people do not support this idea. They consider that everybody should pay for musicians' and producers' work. First of all, creators of music and films spend huge amount of money and efforts on their works. That is why honest people must pay for original discs. It is fair. Secondly, people who copy and share the files not always do it in a good way. In result, download files are in a very bad quality. While bad quality can spoil the opinion about a good film or music. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that illegal pirate copies make worse for original creators. But not all can allow themselves to buy original discs. So, these discs should be more acceptable.
