The given pie-charts represent the amount of materials and products delievered by rail or road in Eastern Europe in 2008. It is obvious that the number of manufactured goods delievered by rail is quite close to the number of the same goods delievered by road, while machinery products are mostly transported by rail. 
Overall, the charts give us a picture of the delivery of some eatable products between all of the Eastern Europe countries. For example, this number of products is 30% transported by using cars or some other road vehicles, whilist only 11% is consumpted after rail delivery. It is shown by the graph that the machinery products are mostly transported by rails, as well as the same goods that were transported by car, were only 2 percent against 12 percent of the previous type of transportation. 
It is clear that the manufactured type of products is send to another countries both by rail and road on a equal level, but products like food were send mostly by road, rather than rail. Therefore, the railways and trains are used to deliver machinery goods.
