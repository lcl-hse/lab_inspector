The charts provide information on transportation of various things between Eastern Europe countries by rail and by road in 2008. 
It can be clearly seen from the charts that the percentage of manufactured goods transported by rail and by road is almost equal (a quarter). However, the highest percentage in the first chart has metals, whereas in the second one food products are the leader. 
Looking at the charts, it obvious that the proportion of machinery transported by road and rail is very different, since for the former it is only 2%, which is the least of all while for the later it is 12%. There is also a big difference in the quantity of metals transportations, as they takes the biggest part in the first chart (35%) and almost the least in the second one (11%). The proportion of chemicals transported by both rail and road is almost the same, with a difference in 5% only.
