But on the other hand, the expand of this oppotunities brings negative influences for producers of films and musicians, because today rising of coping and sharing this products decreases producers' income. 
Firstly, the main reason, why behavior of coping, sharing and downloading illegal files has to be punished, is that hard-work of producers and musicians do not bring them enough money. 
For example, people who do others jobs have stable salary for part of work, wich they do and if their boss does not give enough money salary for them, they will change their jobs. 
On the other hand, the high oppotinities for download these files allows poor people watch this movies and lisen this music too. 
Secondly, people who buying the original version pay their own money for it and other people have to do the same thing.
