There is a sustainable trend on youngsters criminality rate growth. Some people may claim that these high numbers are the result of modern society decay, so that young generation has no moral values to hinder their crime. However I claim that this is not most important reason. To me, it is developing technology that lead to the feeling of lesser crime responsibility, thus youngsters are not afraid of punishment any more. What is left to their life mentors is to increase their morality so that in the world of increased crime opportunity it would be inner rightness preventing people from illegal deeds. 
On the other hand, many elder people now consider youngsters as a spoiled generation with wrong behaviour and no moral constraints. That is why crime rate surged - that is what they think. However, if we look in the history, there were thousand of similar cases in Ancient Greece, European revification period and etc. It is a human psychology feature to think that subsequent generation are worse than they are, that morality fell sharply during their life. 
I personally believe that crime rate grew mainly because of increased crime opportunity. We live in the epoch of developing technologies where it is really easy to rob the bank servers, steal electronic money and even order a crime with the help of illegal websites. For example, Tor is an effective platform for buying guns, distributing drugs and etc. Thus, it became really easy to do illegal things with less chances to be caught. 
To conclude, we should return to moral aspect of crime. Governments can no longer prohibit illegal paths blocking the sites, while they will open again somewhere else - it is just a matter of time. A thorough moral remedy should be considered to cure youngsters and the society itself. 
Diminish crime reasons, so that the problem would disappear.
