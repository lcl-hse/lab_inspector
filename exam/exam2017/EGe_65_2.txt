The problem of the younger generation being involved in most of the crimes is crucial nowadays. People cannot stop wondering: What are the possible reasons to that? Is there anything that can be done to decrease this horrible tendency? In my opinion, one of the reasons of this issue roots in mass media, the Internet in particular. 
Today it offers its users an unlimmited access to enormous amount of different data which should be filtered sometimes. An adult person can hardly handle this relentless flow of information, let alone our children. The perception of the young brain is prone to be influenced by others. For example, there can be found blogs, or groups in social media that have violence propaganda, abuse. Young people may be encouraged to break the law to get what the want or bully others to make them feel better about themselves. Some of these groups are even involved in serious crimes, such as robbery and murders. 
The second reason is parenting. Nowadays we all have such a rush and try to gain more money than we probably can spend. Parents are to busy with work and household chores that they do not pay enough attention to their children. They rarely wonder that their kid is passionate about, whathe would like to do in his life. They mostly worry about their education and future salary. 
This horrible lack of attention makes young folks look for it somewhere else and they find it online where they can do nothing but get sucked into the uncontrollable world of the Net. 
I personally believe, that this issue should be considered as one of the most important. In schools they should teach how to filter the information you get while parens are to take care of the future of their child and pay more attention to their interests and at least be aware of the people that surround their kid.
