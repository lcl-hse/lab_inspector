It is a well-known fact that musicians and film producers lose a lot of money every year from illegal pirate copies, There are a lot of argues on this theme. Some people think, that those who copy and those music and films on the internet should be punished. But others continue copying and downloading files without thinking that it is a theft. I agree with the statement that it's not honest and illegal, but I do not think that it should be punished. 
Firstly, I want to say that I support musicians and producers and their work. And that is why I consider honest to pay for their products: of course it is a quite peasant bonus that we are allowed to listen to music or watch films for free, but in fact it is a theft of artist's money. They invest their money, soul, emotions and energy in their product and I think that we as the audience should pay for this. 
But talking about the consequences I think that punishment it is not a good way. People who download or share files should be banned, but not punished. What is more, in my opinion companies and music labels should think about better level of security of their information. Of course, there always will be people, who will find a way to take it all for freem but it will be harder to do. 
One more point, that I can advice to companies is to minimize price. Maybe in that case people be more likely to buy official products. 
Downloading, copying and sharing pirate copies of music or films is not the worth criminal in the world and that is why I consider that it does not deserve a punishment.
