Over the last few decades there were enormous changes in the way people can get an access to various pieces of media-art, including music and films. One of the questions causing numerous discussions is whether people should be punished for downloading media-files or not. 
To begin, those who believe that downloading of music and movies is extremely bad for musicians and producers are completely right. Firstly, a person who just steals these files from web-sites, denies to admit and take into account all the work that thousands of people have done while creating a movie or a music album, and also all the money, which were spent on turning these projects into life. Secondly, if someone spreads the links on these files all over the social-media pages, he or she does not only turn himself or herself into a thief, but also shows the other people that it is completely normal and acceptable. 
However, there are also those who think it is not an actual theft to download media-files from the internet. Instead, the files were already there and you do not do anything wrong by just watching them from your laptop. Furthermore, people do not find any other solutions, because the prices in cinemas are too high, but they still want to broaden their minds by watching good films. Thus, if you do it with a good educational purpose - it is not a theft. 
Although, there are some truth in the arguments above, I still agree with those people who believe that "downloading" equals "stealing", because most of people do not actually know how expensive it is to create a movie or a song. 
To sum up, copying and sharing media-files on the internet is bad, that is why the government should create a social programme, which will help to make music and films more affordable, so everyone would be able to enjoy these pieces of art.
