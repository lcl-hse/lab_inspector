Nowadays there are a lot of discussions about sportmens who use illegal drugs. Today's pharmacy allows athletes achieve great results in a short period of time and without difficult exercises. That is why some people claim that such kind of athlets should be banned from competing in professional championships at all but the others say that the period when one cannot take part in competiton should be limited. 
First of all, the people who claims on disqualification of the athletes who was caught on using drugs break down the spirit of honest and clear competition. That is why, they cannot be judged the same way as others. Because of being liers and cheaters such athletes should be grounded and they won't be able come back to professional sport. 
It is difficult for some people to accept such point of view that is why they argued that we cannot forbide athletes who used illegal drugs to take part in professional competitions forever because it is their profession and we cannot let them live without job for the rest of their life because of the one mistake. But such opponents do not take in mind the fact that some illegal drugs lead to unacceptable changes in the athlet's body and that is why they cannot be judged like the other who do not use illegal drug's. 
It is clear for me that people who think that athlets should not be banned forever cannot be absolutely right because sport means honesty and true spirit of competition. If we deny it we deny the definition of professional sport. 
In conclusion it is better to say that sport is such kind of human activity that do not accept any kind of lie and cheating. So, illegal drugs should be banned and the sportmen who was caught on taking them also should be disqualified.
