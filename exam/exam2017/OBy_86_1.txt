The unemployment is a big problem for many countries and regions, so people conduct statistics on this. In this graph you can see the unemployment rate in selected world regions: N. Africa, Middle East, EU, Latin America, S. Asia, Worldwide in 2014 and 2015. 
Unemployment is N Africa, S Asia and Worldwide stable in 2014 and 2015. Procent in the Middle, East and Latin America fell. And only the EU has a increase resalt. 
Interesting, that S Asia has the lowest unemployment rates. Next regions, Latin America has a higher than S Asia. The rest by analogy and Worldwide increase the rate. 
Finally, we can to say, that chart unemployment rate has a different indicators. I think, this problem need to be addressed in differents regions, because only in S Asia good indicators.
