The bar chart illustrates data about printed book and eBook markets in the USA, Germany, China, the UK from 2014 to 2018. All numbers given in billion US dollars. 
The common tendency is that print market is the most popular in each of for countries in 2014 (10,5 versus 5,5 in the USA, 6 versus 1 in Germany, 4,8 versus 4,2 in China and so on). Moreover, this is the largest market in general, in comparing even with markets in 2018 (except Germany: print market there in 2014 is equal printed part in 2018 - six billion dollars). But it is absolutely clear, that after four years from describing situation the part of printed books is gradually falls (in the USA it hits 7,5 billion dollars, in China it decrease from 4,8 to 4,2, and in Great Britain printed book market lose 0,6 billion dollars). In Germany situation is stable. In contrast, the part of eBook increases in all these countries (in the USA it rises from 5,5 to 8,5; in Germany it raises from 1 to 1,5. Chinese market of eBook rises significantly 1 versus 0,5 and in the UK we can see uprising from 1,8 to 2,3 since 2014. 
Finally, we can emphasise that eBook market rises meanwhile printed book market constantly decreases through 4 years.
