It is a well-known fact that many people prefer British and American films to locally prodused ones. Why is it so? Let us investigate this problem. 
First of all, we all live in the age of globalization. All cultures become slightly closer to each other. Some scientists even claim that there are no longer any local cultures, as all of them have been replaced with one global culture. Though, parts which different countries take in this global culture are known not to be equal. British and American cultures have influenced other cultures a lot. That is why nowadays people watching films prodused in these countries or reading books written there are indeed connected with that global culture more than those who do not. 
The second reason for people to watch British or American films rather than locally produced ones is that the first, as I personally believe, are more mass-oriented. What I mean by this is that films prodused there do not contain any hidden sense (though some films might pretend to do so, but, in my opinion, it is only a strategy to please someparticular kinds of spectators). The logic of British and American films is quite clear (in comparison to, let us say, Custuritsa's or Kislyovsky's films). It is also possible to say that people do not need to think a lot or to solve some puzzles to completely understand these films. And this strategy works perfectly, as people nowadays like watching films mostly in oder to relax and give their minds some rest. 
To conclude, modern globalized culture cituation and general attitude to films are realy favorable for films prodused in Britain and America, as under these circumstances people tend to watch them instead of locally produced films.
