It is thought, that the creators of films and music lose a lot of money due to the fact that these files usually are spread on the internet illegally, that is why some people are sure that such things should be obliged. 
On the one hand, musicians and film producers fail to recieve the money that they should actually pet after their creations were released. What is more, such things are usually posted in poor equality, thus people who listen to or watch them cannot realise, what great job was done to create it. They will not be able to face the effects the producers use in their films, understand, how wonderful is the sound in the songs. 
Moreover, if we speak about official buying in iTunes, for instance, it also helps the owners of such platforms to pet money. What is more, due to copies more people in the whole world will know about the stuff and its producers. This is the way for them to become even more popular. 
On the other hand, after watching the film or listening to music on the internet a person may deside to go to the cinema or buy the song or even the whole album if he or she liked it indeed. The fact is that if someone knows that really good things were produced and is sure that things really go this way, the creators will recieve even much money. 
All in all, it seems that the producers lose too much money because of copying as at is thought. The spread of their creativity may make them very famous and rich indeed. If a person is popular with things he or she does that will anable to produce more new extraordinary films and songs. Finally, it seems that there is no serious reason for trying to prevent copying.
