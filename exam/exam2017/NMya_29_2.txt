Nowadays the problem of a high crime rate among young people has become a significant problem for society as it affects our security In this paper I would like to suggest the causes of this phenomena and make advise how to tackle with the given problem. 
In my opinion, the most prominent reasons for a high crime rate among young people is a lack of sufficient education in school and high inequality between social classes. Nowadays school provide not enough educational materials and lectures related to the topic of crime. Students do not acknowledge how dangerous their inappropriate actions might be for society and for themselves. As an example, we can observe increased cases of shooting at schools and colleges. Another significant cause of crimes committed by young people is increasing inequality in society. Young people from the lower classes of society are not satisfied with this state of affairs, which drags them to committing more robberies and thefts. Take a student who lacks money for his education and living. The only way for him to get money is to violate the law because he cannot find an appropriate job. 
Considering the causes of high crime rate among young people, schools and parents should provide more education to young people. Teacher and parents should speak more about the danger of becoming a criminal and suggest that young people can achieve success without being perpetrators. 
Taking into account all above-mentioned factors, it is obvious that high amount of young criminals constitutes a serious problem with deep causes. It is to be hoped that educational methods would help in combating this social illness.
