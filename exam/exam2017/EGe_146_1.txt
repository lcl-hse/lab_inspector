The graphs below show the population size's changes in the USA. We can also see birth rate and death rate. According to the graphs, these processes are closely connected. 
From the very beginning, we can see that from 1750 to 1800 the number of people in the USA was quite stable. Death and birth rates were quite similar during this period of time and also remained stable. What is more, birth rate reached its peak in 1800. Then we can see the steady growing of population from 1800 to 1950. During this time death rate fell down dramatically from 1800 to 1850 and then continued to decrease. Birth rate during this period was also getting down until it reached the lowest point in 1950. Furthermore, from 1950 we see that the number of population jumped up while death rate remained the same from 1950 to 2000 and birth rate began to grow from 1950. 
To conclude, we can say that from 1750 to 2000 the population of the USA has been growing up. During these years, there was a tendency in both birth and death rates to fall down. However, birth rate increased in the end of the period.
