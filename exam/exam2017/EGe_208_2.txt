Should governments invest in sheer science, such as space exploration or spend they better to spend money on peoples actual needs? This quesstion remains a controversial one. 
On the one hand, poverty is a country's disease and poor countries (countries of so-called "the third world") simply cannot afford to spend their money on space exploration and other high-dispanseable scientific pieces of reseach. It would be unfair to spend presious resouces, whereas the majority of people suffer trying to make their end meet. Besides, the country's population would not really have a benefit from the developing of Astronomy, at leas in a clear way. 
However, as well as any scientific research, scientific exploration do provide a long-term benefit for a country, such as inclusion in the world shared academic and scientific community. 
However, all those opinions are relevant, I tend to think that country should solve peoples' problems in the first place, and take interest in space exploration only when there is a healthy inner atmosphere in it.
