Problem of crimes is one of the most important for every state, town and citizen. Nowaday, the big number of young people is becoming crimes. I think that we must understand reasons of this problem and try find solvings of it. 
Firstly, there is a necessity in understanding causes of this development. In fact, economic and financial meltdowns are serious problems for everybody. Lack of jobs, activities for young is a concequence of the economic problems. If person hasn't opportunities of legal working or playing, he starts find alternative variants, for example some crime structures. In this case difficult economic's conditionals lead to increasing number of young adults jointed in crime structure and lack of special places for walking, playing leads to a big percentage of children who start communicate with crimes. 
For solving this problem a government, parents and teachers must act. The goverment firstly should stabilize economy because only in stable economy people can look prospects and develop. Also the government must improve conditions of infrastructure for young guys and children because only when they have places for playing can they play enoth and forget about crimes. Parents also need to act. Generally parents are the main models of behaviour for children and sources of knowledges, experiens. Parents can explain bad sides of crime and also can participate in children actions, which is good for their development. Teachers also must create lessons, conversations with young persons. 
So, rising percentage of young people in crime is dangerous trend. It bad because it will lead to significant increasing of number of crimes. I believe that the government has the biggest chances to change situation: the government can create good conditions for development, stabilize economy. But parents and teachers also have influence for young. Participation in games, conversations are good.
