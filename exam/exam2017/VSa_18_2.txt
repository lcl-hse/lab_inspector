Today we can see that modern technologies are becoming more and more integrated into the people's everyday life. But many people wonder whether it is safe for our health to use so much technologies every day, and it is thought by some people that using modern technologies causes huge amount of health problems, and in this essay I will try to It is common knowledge that computers are unsubstitutional in work and everyday life nowadays. But do we remember that it can be harmful for us? Working by the computers causes many dangerous health problems. The most dangerous of them are eyes problems caused by looking into monitor for a long time and illnesses connected with the sitting lifestyle! For example, according to World Healthcare Organization research, more than half of the working population of the developed countries has health problems caused by working sitting in front of computer. 
However, there are some simple ways to stop the developing of such health problems in our body. It is thought by medicals that "the computer workers" must stop their working every 45 or 60 minutes for a short break during which it is recommended to look far away and to do some eye gymnastics. To prevent or reduce sitting lifestyle problems it is good to do sports or heal gymnastics at least once or twice a week. 
It is wrong to not say about some theories about other harmful modern technologies. Some people say that it is dangerous to use mobile phone or microwave oven or something like that. But, unfortunately, today there no science researches proving it. 
Concluding all of the above, it is possible to say that there are indeed some health proplems caused by modern technologies, but we can prevent them with our activity.
