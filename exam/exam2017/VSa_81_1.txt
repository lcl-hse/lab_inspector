The diagram illustrates the development of the print and eBook market in four countries. 
On the first sight, it is foreseen that profit from eBook production in all countries would raise. 
On the contrary, profit from production of print books will fall. Only in Germany this feature will remain on the same level - 6 billion US Dollars per year. 
The most profitable production of print books in 2014 was in the USA. It brought 10,5 billion Dollars. Anyway, specialists say that in 2018 it will bring only 7,5 billion Dollars. In the same time profit from eBook production in the USA will raise from 5,5 to 8,5 billion Dollars. So, the rise is proportional to drop. In German, where profit from production of print books will remain stable, profit from eBook production will not change much, too. It will raise from 1 to 1,5 billion US dollars. In China these features will not almost change profit from eBook production in this country will raise from a halve billion dollars to one and from production of print book will drop from 4,8 to 4,2 billion US dollars. And the same situation, but with other numbers we can now see in the UK. 
Overall, almost in all four countries profit from eBook production will slightly raise and from production of print books slightly fall.
