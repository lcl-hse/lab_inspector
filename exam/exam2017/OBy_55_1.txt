The pie charts illustrate the difference between two ways of transporting various goods in Eastern Europe in 2008. 
At the first glance, we can clearly see that the percentage of transporting different manufactured goods was the highest for the both transportation ways - by rail and by road. To start with, there was a huge difference between the amount of machinery transported by rail, which was about 12%, and by road with only 11% in 2008. The percentage of transporting food products and non-metallic minerals by road was actually two times mire than by rail - 30% and 13% versus about 11% and 7% respectively. As for the chemicals, by contrast, the transportation of this kind of products by rail was definetely less it was by road - 11% and 16% respectively. However, the percentage of metals transported by road, which was about 35%, in a comparison with metals transported by rail, which was 11% there, was 3 times bigger, and, as it was said, the percentage of transportation manufactured goods was practically the same using the both way - 25% by rail and 28% by road.
