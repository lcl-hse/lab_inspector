The charts show what goods were transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe countries in 2008. 
As can be seen from the charts, the main difference concern metals and food products. 35% of metals is transported by rail, which almost three times more than by road. On the opposite, food products tend to be transported by road mostly, and the difference is like in the previous case - 30% against 11%. As for the chemicals and manufactured goods, the difference is insignificant: the same rates for the rail and the road transportation, which are 16% and 28% (accordingly for mentioned goods). Non-metallic minerals are tranported by road mostly: only one third of them is transported by rail. The one more discernible particularity of good transportation in Eastern Europe in 2008 refers to machinery goods. Only 2% of them is transported by road, while 12% - by rail. 
In conclusion it is worth that particularities and means of transport for transportation very often depend on goods and their characteristics.
