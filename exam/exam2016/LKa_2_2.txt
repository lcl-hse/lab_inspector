Some people think that social media in the Internet following purpose like give some information to people, but other people think that Facebook, Vkontakte and other media in the Internet just help people entertain. 
People with the first idea may be true because Facebook and Vkontakte have many groups which showing differents news and have many comments about it. They presenting much advertising about new-opens cafe and lectures which soon are going happening in ypur city. Also, we can get known about lastly new booksor films, sometimes we can research texts of some objects and read it ourselves. On these sites we can see all information about people whose we know or just famous people. Many funats use these resurse that know what like and what doing their lovely stars in simple life. They can chatting with people who is unvalable but wont that other people get known what they feel or think about something. 
However, many people don't use social media for take or get some information. They use Vkontakte that share their photos with other people, or use Facebook that look for their classmates or other friend who on the present days live other countries, because nowadays when is time of globalisation many people travell or work in other country. 
In my opinion I agree with first and second ideas. Because we can use posibilities which we have. In the worls everytime somethings happend and modern men must know about all things. It's good idea share advertising on these sites that a lot of people get know what you want.
