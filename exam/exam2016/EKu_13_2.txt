The issue of safety and all the matters which could possibly be applied to it has always been crucial for people of all kinds as it affects their quality of life. While some people claim that the probable solution is in changing the law, especially the time prisioners stay in cages, others disagree saying that the situation is likely to be influenced by residents' actions. It is widely believed that criminals do not feel like being afraid of the government as the judgement system is easy to be tricked. A well-qualified lawyer, given a big amount of money, can find a solution to minimise the panishment as well as the sentence. Moreover, there is an evidence to suggest that the last is thought to be mild and do not cut the number of crimes. On the other hand, it is commonly known that prison does not seem to improve criminals. Statistics shows that a considerable number of crimes appears to be committed by former prisoners. To this extent, it is suggested that the thifts, robberies, corruption or any kinds of violence should be prevented mainly by society. For instance, anti-crime lessons are to be provided in the schools where pupils could see all the drawbacks of breaking the law. What is more, citizens need to be aware of possible ways of protecting themselves and detering the crimes such as methods of self-protection and possibilities of informing others. In addition, spreading this kind of information might discourage criminals of damaging or murdering. All in all, although measures on prolonging the sentence for crime seem to be quite persuasive, personally I believe that this is not likely to be enough for reducing the number of criminals. What I found more efficent here is to influence people's minds throughout the social means such as school, social advertisements, pamphlets and other ways of propaganda.
