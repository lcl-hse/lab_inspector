In modern society, the economics is dramatically developing all over the world. It also means that many transnational corporations create their business at the third world countries. In what follows I try to compare advantages and disadvantages of this new trend and make a conclusion. It is clear that the factories that built in the third world countries are developing the economics of these countries. So then, the strong famouse companies could employ the local people. That's why local workers can reach the respectful social status and position in this society. Also they have the ability to work at hourse and give the salary. Besides, the fact that the economics of country is increasing means the developing of medicine and the whole medical sphere at the particular state. And, of course, the educational sphere became more important and developed. On the other hand, the creating of global markers that includes the third world countries damage their rich local culture. People do not wear the local clothes anymore, and sometimes they do not celebrate their own holidays that is bind often with religious, for instance. They started to live like western people. It can be seen like they are going to work, probably, office, every day and wear the clothes of office man. In my opinion, the advantages of these world trend could overweight of most of disadvantages. It is better to have at these world more healthy people (with the creating of strong medical help), people who knows their rights because with the developing of economics the laws are developing too. And what, could be more important the death rates are decreasing. In conclusion I would like to stay that trend to creation new business at the developing countries have the amount of advantages that could help people to live longer and to be happier at this like to be employed and have to chance for a god way.
