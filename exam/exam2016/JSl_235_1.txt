The graph under consideration depicts changes in the number of children who are not able to get primary education over a twelve - year period. All people was distributed in three different groups by region and two by sex: Africa, South Asia, Rest of World and boys and girls. In the first time period (2000), as can be seen in a diagram, the figures seem to indicate that Africa was an absolutely leader. It reached a peak at just under 45 millions (20 millions of boys and 23,7 millions of girls). Bur, in 2012 it reached to 32,7 m( 14,5 boys; 18,2 girls). South Asia improved its situation too: from 32,7 m (11,1 boys; 21,6 girls) to 9,9 (5,8 boys; 4,8 girls) as well as rest of world: from 23,3 (10,5 boys; 12,8 girls) to 15,3 (7,7 boys; 7,6 girls). It can be generally concluded that in period from 2000 to 212 there was an upward trend in education level among children not only in several countries, but all over the world (either faster or steadily).
