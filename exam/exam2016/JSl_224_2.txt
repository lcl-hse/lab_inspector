Air travel become more and more popular nowadays. There is not way to travel that worse for the ecology than air travel. Cars, trains, yahts, ships and other types of transport does not pollute air so much. I agree with the point of vie that the governments should reduce the amount of unnecessary flights by laws. The Earth is our planet and all people are responcible for it. There is not necessary for businessman to flight two times a day to have a lunch in the foreign country. Now many problems may be sold via the internet without face-to-face meeting if this meeting lead to global warming. Some people think that offline meeting is better, but they do not remember about the polluting of air travel this moment. Every distance may be claimed by the trains and ships. It is more long, but much more beautiful way to travel. People can see a wonderful nature travelling this kinds of transport. They deny it by flights. There are emergency situations in our life, when we should be in another place for away by little time. It may be in case of some accidents or of something terrible happened with our family members. In this situations flights is necessary way to came the distance, I think. In my opinion, the law that will limit the amount of flights must be introduced. We should not risk our planet and the health of our family and children to solve the business problem or to have a pleasant holydays.
