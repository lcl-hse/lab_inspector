The represented picture provides the information about difference in access to education for children from different region and both gender. There are three region, Africa, South Asia and Rest of World. The main tendency is the big and fast fall of number of children which have access to primary education in all regions from 2000 to 2012. In South Asia umber rises down from above 30 millions to 10 millions and it is the largest fall on the chart. It is interesting that with generally decreasing the amount of boys and girls become equal. Not absolutely, but in general view it is true. The fact of decreasing the level of access to primary school education is really surprising, because it is usually normal when with time educational level climb up, but as for African region it is absolutely another rules. So we can see the proof of it statement in the chart, where number of educating children fall from above 90 million to 55 million for only 12 years.
