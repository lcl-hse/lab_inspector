Many recently researchs show that air travel damage and pollute the air and could lead to global warming problem. This fact had influence to governments to introduce laws for reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I agree with decision to reduce air travels. 
First of all, every person have to understand the position of reducing air travels. Comfortable conditions for one are harmful for all others. If they know that their quality of fly damaged planet and, in future, their lover people, family and relatives, people start to reduce air travels without laws and taxes. 
I strongly believe that people care about relatives and others for do not offer comfortable conditions for themselves ones. Secondly, there are a lot of confirences, trainings, couchings and seminars for business and company development, that located in different countries, so organizations pay money for transporting workers to these evidences. If companies get used to organize the process more better. 
On the other hand, reducing the amount of air travel could lead to bankrout of aero companies, tourism and series spheras will be in hozard of fall. Also the process of globalization will stopped and will not developed. And in order to avoid this catastrofical govnemnts should organize special commitment for making decisions about air travel and air by situation. 
To sum up, every person should take responsibility about problems of global warming and air polution and for supporting these actions government should organize the special air commitment.
