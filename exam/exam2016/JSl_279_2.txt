Nowadays many people suppose that the main purpose of social network should be to shave information and knowledge. However, others claim that the main purpose of them is entertaining people. In this essay, I am going to discuss both sides and explain my opinion. To begin with, social networks such of Facebook or Vkontakte gives one a lot of opportunities for studying and learning something new. For example, it is very common to learn languages or such websites. Moreover, a person can easily share his or her knowledge through such pages and to get followers. It is very usefull as the one who shares information will become more confident and those, who read information, will get new knowledge which can be essential for them in not to distant future. However, not everyone agrees with that point view. Many people are sure that main target of Vkontakte and Facebook is entertaining and interesting. They say that target customers of such websites are teenagers and they do not want to share information and study in their freetime. For instance, most young replaced Facebook and Vkontakte with Instagram, where photos and videos are uploaded without any extra information. To conclude, absolute entertaining is very important for interviewing people, but if cannot attract for a long time. Everyone needs to learn something new and to develop himself or herself. In my opinion, entertaing without learning does not give anything to people, however gaining new information not only makes people more but it is also fun.
