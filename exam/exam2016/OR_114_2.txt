Nowadays parents usually are busy at work and do not spend enough time with their childrens. There are a lot of factors of this situation, which are worthy to be considered. Firstly, it is generally believed that both parents spend a large amount of their time at work. They do their best in order to get enough money for food, clothes, education of their children, ect. Secondary, women recently started work full day, because they had protected their rights. Thus, modern mothers have not got many leisure time on their children as they used to have. This tendency means that the most activities and events child attend with other relatives or friends. Another reasons of such problem is worse economic situation, which makes parents to work at several occupations. It is supposed that this task lead to a lot of bad results. What I mean is the very significant stages of child are exist without attention of their parents. So they often have not hot a change to support in stressful moment or give an helpful advice. Besides, with parents, so the generation become isolated and unclose.
