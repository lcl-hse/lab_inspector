Nowadays everyone speaks about democracy and human rights. And every man is aware of consequences of crimes. However it is still a big problem for every country. More and more solutions are being proposed and one of them is making longer prison sentences. In my opinion, forcing someone to be a prisoner longer than it used to be would not be very helpful in reducing a percentage of crimes. A longer term would not bring benefits to a prisoner. Furthermore, it would make him more violent. We all know that awful things are happening inside jails. Everyday a new crime is happening there and it is nothing to do with this fact. We cannot talk about extending a period of being a prisoner without reorganising jails. To my point of view the best way to reduce crime is building modern prisons which will influence minds of people inside those buildings in a better way. One example is a system of prisons in Norway, where people can read, work, go to the university and even have a separate house. By allowing thiefs or murders opportunity to do whatever they want in a legal way a trusting atmosphere arise. Prisoners do not want to choose the wrong path any more because during the years in such jail they learn to have a different look on this world. Taking everything into consideration I want to say that before giving longer prison sentences we have to look inside this prisons and think about benefits which will have prisoners after their term. If there are no benefits the reorganisation of jail should be held.
