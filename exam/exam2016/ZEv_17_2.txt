There is a fact about air travel harmness for environment. Airjets have incredible impact on air pollution and global warming. Nevertheless, that kind of transport remains unnecessary as for business and leisure as for governments (in this essay). I equally agree with both of these statements, but I think that governments should provide special laws to cut down the amount of air travelling. 
Firstly, air pollution and global warming is not only the business of particular country, but business of humanity at all. So, all counties have to meet and work out the list of laws and rules for aircrafting sector of economics. For instance, higher or extra taxes for using the air area of country. Moreover, the taxes for plane users can be provided. I think, it would be even more effective, because of falling demand. 
On the other hand, there are a lot of standards for ecologically friendly airplanes and airports. Providing more stricked rules governments could gain an ability to shorten pollutions and, as a result, feel themselves calm about ecological system future. 
Despite having these potential resolutions for reducing the amount of air travel there are features and cases which stand unchangeable. For example, all businessmen and businesswomen can't reduce using airplanes due to stricked time schedule - each extra minute could cost extra millions expenditures for them. Moreover, not only business world needs air travelling, usual people use it for reaching distant places of the world to explore it and even make new openings, or just to have a holiday, what matters too. 
To sum up, I agree with the statement about government initiatives to introducing laws, which can frame the amount of using air travelling for business and leisure. Although, they should bear in their minds that this kind of transport is extremely unnecessary for the enormous part of the world.
