The graph illustrates the amount of money that was spent on renewable energy from 2006 to 2013 in developed and developing countries. Also this graph provides a world total investment. Overall, developed countries spent more money on renewable energy in the given period than developing countries. The amount of money has increased slightly from 2006 to 2013 in developing countries, and it reached a peak in 2012 (more than $ 100 bn). As can be seen from this graph, the investment on renewable energy in developing countries rose and reached a peak in 2011. Despite this fact, the indicator of spending money decreased. There is a dependence between the world total investment and investment in developed countries. The world total investment had grown up, and reached a peak in 2011 (279 $ bn). After this point the line went down. To sum up, developed countries always invested more money than developing countries. The world total investment partly depended at the investment of developing countries.
