Today there are a lot of different companies that are engaged in a variety of industries. The population has not enough work and the companies are demanding more quality recruitment. Usually companies that move into poor, developing countries, deal with hazardous substances. In poor countries, the majority of people is unemployed. They are ready to do any work. Even if the work can be a very bad influence on the health and even to kill. Perhaps, this is the main advantage. A large number of people who are willing to sacrifice themselves in order to feed their families. Also it can serve as a reason for moving that the poor countries many areas what are all unused. The local population has no money to develop it and build their businesses. That's why more companies are located in developing countries. They move their businesses to these areas and develop, learning resources of the country. Given that as a rule the population of poor countries is very large business begins to flourish. Labor and many resources do their work. The downside of this policy may be just what to sell products of their activities among the local population is almost impossible. The country is poor, and people have no money. Therefore it is necessary to spend extra money to transport the finished product to other countries. Thus, in my opinion, the benefits of moving businesses in poor, developing countries are much greater than the disadvantages.
