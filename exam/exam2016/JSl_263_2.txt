Nowadays people discuss the main purpose of social systems. Some say it is just for fun, others argue that social media is a major source of information today. In this essay I will discuss both points of view and give my opinion. First, let me start with the view that social media is not only bad entertainment. Facebook and Vkontakte are the source where every news item appears immediately. Surfing these sites one doesn't have to listen to the radio or watching TV to stay on track. Moreover, access to these network systems let people share documents, projects, videos, pictures that might be useful for studying or work. For example, all students nowadays use the internet to share opinions about homework or simply help each other to understand sometimes. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the view that the major aim of surfing network systems is entertaining. It is not secret that most people hang on VK or Facebook to relax after a busy day watching funny videos and images. Sometimes it means just wasting time, but on the other hand, it might be the only chance to award life hundles for some people. Besides, in our global world social media is the only opportunity to keep in touch with friends and relatives abroad. Many regard this possibility as relaxing and entertaining, not sharing the information. To sum up, taking into consideration both views I would say that social media is abroad sharing information as well as entertaining. To my mind, these sources give us a lot of advantages. They way to use it depends on the person and the one wants to satisfy.
