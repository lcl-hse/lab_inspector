Nowadays, more and more companies prefer to place their businesses in the developing countries. On the one hand, no one can deny that in the cost of products made by workers in developing countries is cheaper than ones in developed so it's obviously better for companies, who can produce more goods for the same amount of money and be more competitive on the market. Moreover, the people in developing countries suffer from the lack of working places, but they can go work as employees of the international company in case if it moves its businesses in that country. Also, it increases the economy of poor countries by investments that are made by the developed countries for the development of business. On the other hand, on my opinion, there is more harm than good caused by this way of doing business. Why are these products so cheap? Companies tend to pay to local workers of the developing country less then they pay to workers in their own country. Time of working isn't limited, so workers can work 12 hours a day and that why the productivity grows. Also, companies can employ children because of the absence of the low that forbid children to work. Often, if in their own country there is a low regulating the environment harm, companies place harmful production in the developing countries and became the cause of environmental problems there. To sum up, this development brings a lot of advantages to those who already has money but makes life of those who lives in the poor countries even worse.
