Nowadays, a lot of people argue about advantages and disadvantages of air travel. Some people say that it's the most convenient way of travel for business and leisure. Other think that air travel is unnecessary and the government should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel because it lead to high level of air pollution and global warming. In my view, humanity haven't invented good substitute for planes and we can't reject from air travel. 
I totally disagree with views that air travel has a big negative influence on the nature. Recent years, humanity has faced the problem of global warming and, obviously, we try to find reasons for it in all things. In my opinion, during the process of making production, factories explode more shot-gas that planes during the flight. So, it will be more useful to close factories. What is more, also in comparison with cars, planes make less air pollution. 
Also, I disagree with opinion that a lot of air travel is unnecessary. Firstly, it's necessary for businessmen to get just time on far meetings. So they can't substitute air travel with another kind of transport. Secondly, if airporst start to delay flights, it can lead to increase in price of air tickets, due to high demand and low supply. Thirdly, due to low amount of flight, some small air companies might not be able to pay their fixed costs and have to leave the market. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that the best way to solve the problem of pollution is science. We should develop our engenies, invent ecolgical-free fuel and remain air flight because we can't live without air travel.
