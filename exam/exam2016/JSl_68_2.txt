In the modern society there is a n issue which generates same headed debates. Today many international companies move their business to poorer and developing countries and employ local workers. Of course there are some advantages and disadvantages of such development. Firstly, it is a good idea to move some business from developed countries to the places are not so developed yet because this action can become a force on the way of development and well-being of the country. For instance, if in the area there are not so many work places, the international companies will employ local workers. Maybe, this decision will safe people from the death and help them to deal with unemployment. But on the other hand there are some disadvantages. In the country where people get used to unemployment and their lifestyle it can be so hard to bring in their area new rules. New form of living can before the cause of misunderstanding, flights and furthermore the deaths. One noticeable example is an South part of Africa where local people didn't agree with the invitations of international American companies in the 50-th of 19th century and killed the cklegation. All in all, reflecting pluses and minuses I've come to decision that the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages at all. And it is a good idea to move business from developed countries to countries.
