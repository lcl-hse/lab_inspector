Our society has become more open and mixed-cultured with the invention of airplanes. Air travel gave people ability to visit far ends of the world. But is this invention safe for the planet we live on? 
It is said that airplanes pollute air and this is certainly an awful thing. So from one point of view, it is necessary to reduce the number of flights made on a daily matter. First of all, our duty is to safe planet from our own existence and it seems reasonable to cut the amount of air travel. Government should push laws concerning the air traffic, but they also must consider the consequensies. This means that regarding the fact that people are not prepared to sacrafice their right to travel. They will search for alternative ways to travel. So, no wonder, if the amount of cars, buses and other means of transport would take their lead. 
To my mind, it is irrational for governments to enforce air companies to decrease the number of flights considerably. That may lead to other problems which are harder to solve. Moreover, closing air space over some countries as a way of reduction air traffic may be considered as a threat by other countries which would cause more tension than ever before. 
In other words, the idea of considerable intervention in the air travel by government is a complete failure. Companies must decide themselves if they are ready to sacrafise their incomes for the sake of planet or not.
