The diagram illustrates the dynamics of availabiliry of general education for children from various regions of the world in 2000 and 2012. 
Overall, first, the quantity of children without the ability to get a primary school education decreased from the beginning till the end of the period. Second, the maximum level of uneducated children was in Africa, while there was a bigger access to knowledge in the Rest of World. 
It is noticable, that all regions have minimized the number of children, who could not go to a primary school. For example, there was a strong downward trend in Africa - from nearly a quarter in 2000 it became lower and reached a point of around two millions less than 20 in 2012 for girls, and approximately the same decrease was for boys - 20 and 14,5 millions. Moreover, a big fall was in South Asia - the number of uneducated girls in 2012 was roughly 5 times smaller than in 2000, which was 4,8 and 21,6 millions respectively. 
As it is evident, the highest point of children without ability to get a primary education in both years was being hit in Africa - in sum there were 43,7 and 32,7 millions in 2000 and 2007 respectively. At the same time, the most stable figures had the "Rest of the World" region, which at the beginning of the era hit a low of nearly 10,5 millions of boys without education and roughly 3 millions more than ten of girls. Afterwards, the number of boys and girls in this Region, who could not get an education, became approximately the same - 7,6 millions in 2000 and 7,7 in 2012.
