The bar chart gives information about contribution into renewable energy made by two types of countries - developed and developing ones- thorout the 2006-2013 period. The apparent feature of the graph is that developed countries invested much bigger sums into such development. For instance, in 2008 developing countries spend two times as much money as developed countries did. According to the bar chart, the pick of the investment was in 2011. About 280 billion dollars was given in order to develop renewable energy industries in that year. However, after 2011 the amount of world total investment decreased from 27.9 billion of dollars to only 214 billion dollars to only in 2011 and 2013 relatively. As for the previous years, the popularity of renewable energy usage used to be much smaller accounted for only 100 billion dollars investment in 2006. To conclude, it would be essential to say that though the money contributed in 2010 were much more than in early years, the tendency is about to decline, despite the fact that the amount are still larger than in pre-2011-year period.
