Nowadays a lot of people use air travel for their business and free time activities, but we know that planes are not very good for out nature. So I agree that government should control the amount of air travel. Firstly, I think that we need to protect Earth from ourselves, new laws about air travel can be first step. We use gas and oil for planes, also we use ferrum for engeenering. This is very harmful for planet. Also because of planes influence on atmosphere, level of air pollution and global warming rise in future. Furthermore, to my mind, these new laws can be oportunity for science. They can develop some kind of new transport type or try not to use natural gas or oil but use trash or waist. Nowadays we can read about dzones. We can't travel with help of them. But if we talk about mail or global shop delivery where dzones can be more effective than planes. For example last year big internet shop Amazon use dzones for delivery. They did it for advertising but why we can't do this in our lives too? Also we can't forget about our health. Air travel is not very helpful. Some doctors say that you will influenced by some radiation then you are in the sky. Pregnant women are not allowed to travel by plane, is not this a point of harmful influence? On the other hand we can't forget about human rights. We can travel, can have business in different country, can visit relatives. And government can't cancel all air travel and close the gates. To conclude, I would like to say that we need to be careful for our planet, our health. And population need to find golden line where our rights and our duties have the same level of importance.
