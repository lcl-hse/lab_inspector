In our days companies became more and more powerful and many of them moved their businesses into other countries in order to rich international status. Some of them also move in the developing countries and offering the job to local people. But is this the key to success for both sides or it make the situation became worst than earlier? In my opinion, moving international business to developing countries is a good decision for boths. Firstly, I think, that happiness of people are more important that the governments. Lots of people moved to other countries and have a very difficult life there trying just to have some money for their family while they don't have an opportunity to see their reality for a long time. Since the companies move to their countries this people don't have a need to go for from home anymore, they can work there and have bigger salaries than other jobs at their country. Secondly, this development can help to developed countries with a problem of migration. When a people from poor countries have their works at home, the wave of migration decreased. According to statistics, more than a half of immigrant moved from native county just in order to find a job and have an opportunity to send money from their families. To sum up, it should be said that the development of international companies into developing countries is bad for economy of this countries, but I still strongly convinced that this disadvantage is not so important as a happiness of huge amount of people in the poor countries.
