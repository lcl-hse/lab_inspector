The largest change happened in South Asia where the number of girls and boys without the access fallen in about 4 and 2 times relatively. The region with the biggest number of children without the access to Africa in 2000 the second biggest number of children was 14 South Asia. However, in 2012 the situation changed and then second biggest number of children turned out to be in the rest of the world region.
