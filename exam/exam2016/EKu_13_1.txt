As it can be seen from the first chart, the number of people who use to enter in Facebook from their desktops in March 2012, what accounted approximately 150 million users, decresed slightly as the number of those in March 2013 was only about 135 million users. On the contrary, there is a considerable growth of circa 40 million users in the number of people using Facebook via mobile phones. Considering the reasons for entering in the social network, opinions difeer significantly. More than a half of women tend to believe that they use Facebook for sharing their photos and videos, while less number of men, accounting only 39%, consider this reason to be as relevant as receiving updates. However, the percentages of males who believe seeing funny posts to be the main reason for entering Facebook is rather bigger than that of women. Only a quarter of asked men responded that learning aboout ways to help others in Facebook is crucial, what is 10% less than that of women. All in all, from the charts it is clear that an overall usage of Facebbook increased in 2013 and more of it is via mobile phones.
