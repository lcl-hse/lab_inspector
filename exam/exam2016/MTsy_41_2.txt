"Air travel has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollytion and global warming. As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure."
It is a well known fact that today there are a lot of ways to travel such as car, train, underground, booths and of course airplane, which is the most popular. Some people belive that air travel make much air pollution and is the reason of global warming, so they argue that we need reduce the amount of air travel to avoid natures problems. Other people say that we need to try to find scintific way to decline air pollution from plan, without changing amount of air travel. I fully agree with the second group. 
First of all, I supose that people mast have an apportunity to travel because it help us to travel. I mean that, it is a chance for tourist visit all over the world, learn new cultures, broaden their horisens. For example, Airplane is the best way foe man, who live in Sibiria, where weather is cold full time, visit sunshine beach. 
The second reason, why I strongly belive that we really need in Air travel is access to other countries experience in medicine of business. According to the statistic a lot of people with some horible diseases can get cvalificate help only in japan. For example, so they must travel only by airplane because it is the faster way to japan from UK, for example. 
To sum up, I would like to say that that if governments introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel, we will lose an apportunitu to travel in another countries and island. In addition to this we willose chance to get cvalificate help from other countries. That's all lead to sharp decrease of living standarts.
