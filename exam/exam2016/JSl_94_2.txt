Nowadays, a lot of international companies have kind of trend to change their businesses location. They prefer poore and developing countries as their production. This invention in business sfier has many advantages as well as disadvantages. Many people think that it is one of the most greatest tricks in business. I totally agree with these people and in my opinion this idea have a lot of pluses. Firstly, work force in developing countries are not so expensive compare to developed countries. For example, China has the most cheap work force in all over the world. That is why such big international companies as Apple, Samsung move their businesses in China. Secondly, developing countries have a lot of nature resources, that is why companies want to be closer to this resources and do not spent a lot of money to transportation. Thirdly, big world popular companies provide a huge number of job vacancies for local workers. However, some people think that all this new businesses in developing countries pollute the atmosphere, and the number of resources decrease very fast. First of all, international companies spent a few money for producing goods. That is why they buy cheap filtres and pollute the air. For example, in Bejin the environmental situation is very bad because of big number of factories. Furthermore, it is not very good for companies, because they need to spent money for transferring all goods in to the companies home country. In conclusion, I think that this innovation has bought some negative impacts, nevertheless, more positive effect. And I believe that scientists will think up how to reduce pases that pollute air and create the layer of ozone.
