In the chart we can see how number of children without acess to primary education by region and gender. For all years we see, that girls without access a lots then boys, but this rule have one exeption - South Asia 2012. Its wonderfully, but from 2000 to 2012 near by 40 million children has got acess to school education. Next we see some some details. In South Asia 2000 girls, who has no acess some less, than Africa 2000. But in South Asia 2012 girls, who has no acess more then 12 million less, then South Asia 2012. This mean, that South Asia really solve this problem. 
In finnaly I give one interesting fact: all over the world 2012 children, who has no acess, more less, than one Africa. This work in 2000 year too. And, tfust, we have positive tendention, this mean, that world community solve this case.
