The bar chart provides information about the average amount of time people of different ages and genders spent on sport activities in Britain in 2012. Overall, it can be seen that men are more fond of sport than women. As the chart illustrates, the UK residents at the age of 16-24 were most sport-active both men and women (282,1 and 114,1 minutes respectively). Then there is a dramatic decrease in the time spent doing sport and exercise: 25-34 old made britains did exercises almost 2 times less. From 35 to over 75 years old period the amount of sport activities in mens life declined slightly with a moderate rise from 52,7 to 60,5 minutes, compared groups of 55-64 and 65-74 years old people respectively. As far as women are concerned, the amount of sport in their lives had gentle downward trend. While the youth spent doing sport 114,1 minutes, older women at the age 25-44 years old had such activities at the numbers of 92,8 minutes. To sum up, there is an obvious correlation between the average time spent doing sport and exercise and the age of the people, while men still more active in this issue.
