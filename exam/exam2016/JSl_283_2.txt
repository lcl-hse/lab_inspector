Due to the Internet social media has become available to all people over the world. But now people should use it? Some points out that people can use it to communicate with people and share information and knowledge while others say social media is used to entertain people. I will consider both points of view in this essay. Nowadays a lot of people have smartphones with the internet and access to social medias. It is easy to find news and need information. However, if news item is timey it can save your life. A god example of it could be terracts in Brussel. When it happened, the information about it spreaded quickly via social medias and people who had plans to go to this city cancelled it. However, social medias are a good sources of entertainment. Everybody knows how it is easy to spend a lot of time in social media chatting with friends, looking pictures, reading blogs. For example, instead of preparing for this exam I was watching stand-ups in a group in Vkontakte. Social medias have a big role in our lives. Modern social medias combine both sharing information and entertaining. In my opinion, social media shouldn't focus on one aspect, as everyone can choose how he use it according to his behavior.
