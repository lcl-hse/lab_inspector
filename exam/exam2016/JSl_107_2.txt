It is no doubt true that many international companies change their location and places their offices in developing countries. Some people argue whether there are the disadvantages or the advantages. In my opinion, in this case the advantages significantly outweigh the disadvantages and explanation of this will be discussed in this essay. The positive side of such situation can be considered in two levels: for companies and employers, and for citizens of developing countries, where companies move. As it is known average salaries in developed countries are in high position in comparison with developing countries. Consequently for companies it is better to pay less to employees and get the same amount of income. So decision to move to poorer countries to use cheaper work force seems sensible. Also, a lot of materials are come from developing countries, therefore being doing business there is more effective and again cheaper. On the citizens' level there are extremely good job prospects for employees in fact that in developing countries the level of unemployment takes high meanings. Due to international companies this problem can be solved and most employees may allow themselves more than they could. Some people have different view on this problem and claim that such interventions can destroy economies of developing countries with taking most employees positions. In my opinion, international companies are not harmful, otherwise they help states to cope with unemployment, investing money in these countries. In conclusion, despite the fact that international companies may be harmful for economics of developing countries, they can provide citizens of these countries with job. Also, there are visible advantages for companies because of cheaper work force and materials.
