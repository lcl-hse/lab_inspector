Today the choice of the kind of the right strategy used in businesses quite important issue for not only multinational companies, but also for those developing countries, which has played more and more significant role in the international business and trading big and famous corporation, such as, Apple has managed to use the labor of the local workers in those countries, where the factories for these corporations are located. This is highly productive way for making business, and to my mind, this is very beneficial for both sides of the world process. In my opinion, there are more good points in using labor of local workers than disadvantages. First of all, the level of living in poorer countries is significantly lower than that of rich countries. That is why such countries suffer from the lack of the job. But these corporations provide these workers with it. Secondly, corporations, such as, Apple decrease their expenditure on the salary and may spend more money on developing some innovative products, rather than satisfy the needs for workers. And finally, huge, unpleasant and hazardous factories don't spoil the appearance pf the cities where the main offices of the corporations are located because the factories are in poorer countries. However, quite a lot of people claim that it is unfair to influence people's health in developing countries. The worry about the future of these workers, who has to spend the gaz or chemical products. Also, some people say that the rewards are distributed unfairly and the salaries are too low in those developing countries. In spite having some disadvantages I personally believe that soon the quality of life in poorer countries will be improved and for me. The benefits of such co-working are more significant, because both sides, the corporations themselves and the local workers benefit from this strongly of doing business.
