Some people say that the main purpose of social media such as Facebook and Vkontakte should be to share information and knowledge. Others say the main purpose should be simply to entertain. Social media have become extremely important in nowadays life. Facebook has over a billion users while Vkontakte is used by more than 200 millions people. But why are they so popular? What's their purpose for that many users? Some people state the main purpose of social media is to share knowledge and information. with the simplicity of a built in messaging interfare, it has never been easier to communicate any idea or subject to a friend or even to a teacher or tutor. Moreover, there are many groups and communities that provide you with interesting and useful information. For example, there are web pages on social media that show you the photos of famous pieces of art and give their history. However, others argue that social media were created mostly for entertainment purposes and they have their point: if you look at a profile of an average social media user, you're more likely to fins funny pictures or videos that have no educating purpose whatsever. Moreover, most of the information provided on education Vkontakte or Facebook pages is false or not proven. Personally, I believe neither of the groups is right. On my opinion: the main purpose of social media is communication. I use social media mostly to chat to my friends or to keep in touch with people I don't have time to meet with. I believe social media were created to simplify communication with old friends or so you can keep in touch with people you meet and the subject of your conversation may very from exchanging important ideas about the creation of Earth to laughing at a funny cat video.
