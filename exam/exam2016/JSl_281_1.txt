The bar chart illustrates the average time spent for sports in England in the year 2012 by age and gender. Overall, the two most striking trends are that men spent more time for doing exercises than women and the total amount of minutes decline through the elder stages of life. It is can be clearly stated from the chart that men spend generally more time doing sports than women are. The biggest gap in the time spent in such a way as gender is seen in the age group of 16-24 years old people with men prevailing women more than two times. This trend is smoothing with the further age groups with group of 55-64 years old as an exception with women spending 3 minutes more than men. Another feature observed is that throughout a person's life cycle with no response to gender there is a declining trend in minutes spent for sports. Started with 282,1 minutes for men and 114,1 for women the chart ends with approximately ten-times drop in numbers among both groups. To conclude, as it can be observed from the chart under question in 2012 in England men generally spent more time doing sports than women and with age both groups tend to reduce this kind of time spending.
