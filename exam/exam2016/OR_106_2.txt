There are a lot of facilities around us such as cinemas, clubs, shops, restaurants and others. We would like to try all of them but it costs a lot. That is why parents should work hard. They want all the best for their children. However, due to full time job of both parents children can lose connection with their parents and may feel loneless. Some people claim that if is normal when both parents have full-time job, life in modern world really costs a lot. Parents want a good education for their children. Good kindergardens and private schools provide qualified education but you should pay for it. Also, parents try to give their children interesting toys and modern technologies. Children's cloth and toys are very expensive nowadays. Others believe that toys and gadjets are hod the most important things in the world, they claim that parents love and care are more important than money. I partly agree with this statement because parent's patient and care are important but it will lose it's weight it the family will not have money for food or cloth. There is one more reason why both parents can have full-time job. May be, they like to work and their job bring positive effect on society. If both parents are doctors or firemans they do important job for many people. People do choises all the time and working parents also should do them. If they want, they will find time lot both for their children and for the job.
