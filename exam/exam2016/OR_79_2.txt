Nowadays the majority of people prefers air travel to other ways of transportation. The government could regulate the amount of air travel because they influence to environment. In my opinion, it is really essential to decrease air travel as it can be result of big problems in future. Firstly, the great deal of planes causes of air pollution. Such significant quantity of gases has been thrown away and as a result atmosphere suffers. That is why state authorities should reduce flying on plane. Secondly, today there are lots of unnecessary races that can be changed or collected in one. For instance, sometimes in official websites of companies people can face the cheap tickets because they are not necessary. At the same time, not only air travel effect on environmental condition but many other causes. For example, scientific experiences are more harmful for surrounding. To my mind, scientists should find such method to travel in air without harm. But while it is not investigated. That is why only government can find solution of this problem. To sum up, there are disadvantages of air travel but it is essential to allow people to use this kind of transportation. The government should only reduce the amount of these but not ban in all.
