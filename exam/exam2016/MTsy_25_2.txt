In today's world people often travels for a long distances by airplanes in order to spend their holidays or in a business trip. Some scientists say, that a lot of air travel causes senting pollution into the atmosphere and as a result, a global warming. These people convenience governments to bring some measures to reduce the amount of air travel. From my point of view, I somewhat disagree with this idea. 
The first thing that is need to be said is that no one can ban people to choose the way, which they want to travel. If someone choose air travel, than this person could do it because he pay money for it and he has a freedom of choice. 
Another good thing about air travel is that it is very fast kind of transport. In this way, it is very helpfull for businessmen, who go to their business trip. Furthermore, there are some places in what we should't go without airplanes. We should have access to this kind of travelling in anytime and as many as we need. 
On the other hand, air pollution and global warming, as result of that is really a big problem in our modern world. A large number of air travels may lead to serious problem in our modern world. 
A large number of air travels may lead to serious problems for our environment. What is why, in order to protect our planet from global warming governments should take some measures. Perhaps, reducing the amount of air travel is one of these point, but from my point of view, it should be done as one of the last measure. 
In conclusion, I would like to say, that I think, intriducing laws to reduce the amount of air travel is generally unnecessary in the modern world because it can cause a lot of uncomfortabilities for many people. Government should find another decision to reduce air pollution and avoid global warming.
