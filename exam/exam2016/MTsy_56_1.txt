Studies, made in year 2000 and 2012 conducted information about number of children without access to primary education. Data was sorted by region and gender, and presented on a diagram. 
First of all it is needed to tell that main trend is positive Since 2000 till 2012, percentage of children, who cannot access primary education all over the world lowered from 23,3 per cent rate to 15,3 per cent. It is important, that girls growth rate is almost two times higher than the boys' (-5,2% versus -2,8%). 
The most fascinating results were discovered in South Asia region, where overall rate of uneducated children rapidly dropped from point of 32,7 percent to incredibly low 9,9 percent - that's the lowest rate in this study. Moreover, the number of girls, who cannot receive primary education dropped from 21,6% to 4,8%. So high rates might be the result of the women emancipation in the region. 
Speaking of the last, but not the least region of this study, Africa, it is noticeable that constantly poor level of education in this region might be enhanced in future, because now overall percentage of those children, who do not have access to primary education is on the same level as in 2000 in South Asia. 
To sum up, number of children without access to primary education is lowering. The highest rates of that lowerage are spotted in South Asia region. There percentage of 2000's is two times larger than in 2012. African region still faces obstacles on the way to educated population, but rates of kids without ability to reach primary education there surprisingly bigger than in the world overall.
