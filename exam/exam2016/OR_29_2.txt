Nowadays it is becoming more and more popular to say that air travel in future will result to air pollution and rising temperatures. Also, many authorities suggest to make the less amount of our travels. I am completely agree with this position, because the airplanes throw a lot of gases to the Earth atmosphere. 
Today our population has a lot of types of transport; for example: cars, buses, trolleybuses, metro, air planes and others. But in my opinion, airplanes are more dangerous for ecology that other one. Airships fly for a long distances with big speed. And when ships are flying, they throw a great amount of dangerous fuel things to the atmosphere. Nevertheless to their high speed and comfort, airplanes can contribute not only air pollution, but global warming too. As for reseachers opinions, a great amount of airplane travels isn't necessary for people. And many scientists ask a question: what should we do with this situation? 
A lot of authorities suppose that it is simple to write the rules and laws, which will protect a big amount of travels. But as for me, this solution won't be effective. Every year, people are travelling to different places for the relaxing and for the business deals. It won't reduce this issue at all. Moreover, the new problem will appear: many countries will have a poor income of transport services. 
In conclusion, I want to say that our atmosphere is not a rubbish cabin. Our population should save it for future generations. And if Governments reduce the amount of air travels, it will not help to save the nature. In my opinion, we should do more actual solutions, for instance: push rubbish into cabins, some water, forests, don't pollute air with help of smoking and other. And after that, the problem of global warming will disappear.
