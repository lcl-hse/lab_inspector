Usage of airplanes affects extremely unfair on air and nature. As a reason o fit government meets the issue of reducing the level of frequency of travelling by planes. I believe that government must do everything that it can to save our nature from pollution and other problems. 
In my opinion government should care about all the problems that connected with nature, because for air companies and its holders saving our nature doesn't give and benefit. So the laws like high tax rates will help to reduce negative impact on air and get money for cleaning it that will increase the utility of government. 
On the other had every tax causes negatively on economic issue. However, a revenue of air companies will decrease, the prices for fly will become higher and someone will not have possibility to travel for a holidays. 
By the way, I suppose that we should think not only about the economic side of a problem. It is obvious that oar pollution ang global warming have a negative impact on social welfare. It is known fact that increasing level of social welfare is the main purpose of government. 
To conclude I want to notice that government should use its institutions to improve the welfare of its citizens and I strongly believe that high tax rates on air companies will help to save our nature and protect us from other unconsidered consequenses of global warming.
