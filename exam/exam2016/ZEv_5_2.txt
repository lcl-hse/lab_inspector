It is supposed that the governments should reduce the amount of flights due to it causes air pollution and global warming. In my view, it is partly true. 
First of all, it should be clear that we live in 21st century. My point is that nowadays corporations are biggest part of our economy. And the fact of corporation's existense usually deneds on their successful deals. In order to make one of those, CEO has to meet different people as often as he can. And there is no better mean of transport for CEO than airplane. 
Furthermore, in many countries, such as Greece, Malta, Egypt, Turkey etc. economy strongly depends on tourism. If the tourists flow decline in this countries, they will have economical problem, such as recession, big inflation or even default. And all this actions will take place, if the governments forbid air travel. 
However, there're some arguments which prove the author's statement. The main of them is that airplane spend dozens tons of fuel which can pollute the atmosphere and in the nearest future there are no substitutres for the air fuel. 
All in all, I can't say whether I'm strongly agree or disagree with the following statement, because both sides have their point. But if it were my choice, I'd rather not reduce the amount of air travel.
