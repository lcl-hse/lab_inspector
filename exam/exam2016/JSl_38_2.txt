In today's world full of contrast disagreement the problem of pollution caused by air transport gains more popularity day in day out. Some people say that governments should control our transport system and reduce the amount of or travel. First, the airtransport is one of the most safe and the fastest ways to take people from point A to point B. secondly, when people accident with planes happens there are not o lot of bad influence for environment. For instance, when ship sinks many animals die because of gasoline or oil coming out from the trunks. However, there are some people who are in ship dissagreement with this opinion. Critics are quide to point out that planes are safe for persons who want to travel but dangerouse for other part of mankind because of high level of pollution which was caused by air travelers and that's why we should stop using airtransport. But other part of critics are absolutely sure that this opinion is far from reality because the progress in airways will influence on researchers and they will invent new types of engine which will use less gasoline. To conclude, it isn't difficult to give full justice to the problem of pollution caused by air travel. I think that in the future planes will use less gasoline or petrol and governments should not introduce lows to control the amount of air travel.
