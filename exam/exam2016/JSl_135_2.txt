There is a gap between developed and developing countries, which characterized by some points. A lot of companies prefer locate their business in other countries with sicker economy. In my opinion advantages of this action outweight the disadvantages for employees and employers too. First of all, rich large international companies which situated their businesses in porer countries influent on the economy of the country and improve it in a good way. They also help to decrease the level of unemployment which can be very high in particular country. Many successful companies like Apple or Samsung built their factories in Indonesia and other countries, because in these countries they will spend less money on payment to local workers. Another pros can be suited only for businesses. It is expected that in porer countries they will pay less not only for work but for rent of buildings and place. There are electricity, water, repairing and other services much more cheap in poorer countries than in richer. there are also some disadvantages, which seem to be harmful only for local countries businesses and companies. International company may have the leading position in the market and create some kind of monopoly for some kinds of goods. Smaller companies are existing on the market can loose their money and customers. To avoid this, governments should create comfortable conditions for all kinds of actors on the market from international companies to private sellers. In conclusion it is have to be saying, that not only international companies will have profit from moving their businesses to developing countries, but these countries will develop faster with help of money and new work places. It cannot be any phenomenon without disadvantages, but in this particular situation it is good idea with more advantages than disadvantages.
