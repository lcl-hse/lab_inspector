No doubt nowadays there are as developed countries as developing and both of them develop in different ways. Developed countries are richer and more successful in their economical approach than developing. So, today many international companies try to help develop the potential growth of developing countries and move their businesses into them. From my point of view there are more advantages than disadvantages, but I want to look at this problem from the both sides. First, helping in developing by international countries could be the first step on the right way of developing the society. They can help to economics of these countries and help them to become better. For example, employing the local workers, they give them special skills to work better, so they improve their qualities in different ways of their job. Also, they try to increase economic of developing countries by helping with adjustment and choosing the right way of thinking. On the other hand, tutoring by developing countries have a negative side because they don't give them a chance of developing by their own. So, they try to make a decisions beyond developing countries and moving business into developing countries can lead to losing the historical of that place. Therefore, developed countries can swallow up developing because of it's pouer and improving. They can make a descision of developing the structure, society and economic of these countries, that can be a reason of dying the personal opinion and point of view. In sum, from my point of view there are more advantages of moving business by international companies to developing countries rather than disadvantages.
