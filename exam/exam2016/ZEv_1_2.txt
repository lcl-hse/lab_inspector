Since it was proven that air travel contributes greatly to air pollution and global warming, governments must find new alternative solutions in order to keep the advantages of air travelling. 
Air travel is the only way for us to travel to the different part of the world in less than a day. Nowadays, when time is our greatest resource, it is priceless. If government will ban air travel for business and leisure flights we will drop back in 'time' for decades. it is very necessary to keep on the same level and at the same time research for new, alternative ways to decrease the contribution of air pollution and global warming. 
The problem of global warming is standng sharp nowadays. Governments almost no progress. In my opinion they must force scientists to research deeper, instead of banning things that are common. They should start from their own fabrics that are dropping tons of gas to the atmosphere. 
Third, if the government will introduce the low, reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure, they risk to cause a drammatical fell in world's economy. People will not have a possobillity to sign a contract, pass documents, talk in person. The price of hotels will raise because people will no longer have choice. 
To summarise, I would say that the ban of air travel is not a way of solving this global problem, it may rather cause many new. It must not be a harm to the population, government must find an alternative solution.
