The problem of air pollution and leading by it global warming is debited for many years. I understand the fairs of people about that and their efforts for the protection of our planet. But I believe that law regulation of flights is too radical and I am going to prove my arguments for his point view in my essay. It is well-known that every engine produces CO2. Even electrical cars because you need firstly burn coal orgas to produce electricity. Alternative ways are unpopular nowadays and how efficient except nuclear energy. It is true planes are the leaders in consumption. Nevertheless aircrafts are the quickest way to transfer people and goods. All economy is based on business. Open economy provides constent GDP growth and the main key of success is trade. Before delivery of goods, bargain needs to be made. Use of telephone or internet for such deal is uncomfortable. Cartraets are always done face-to-face. As I fold before trade is an engine of rational and global economic welfare. So limits for business air trips is not affordable. Tourism is also a key element of cross-culture communication. It is a foundament of some economics, specialized in tourism. Limitation in leasure flights would create a disproportion in cash of such countries. As we can see the flights for leasire and business occasions are very important and we can sacrifice them, even for our society.
