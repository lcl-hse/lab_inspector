The given chart compares data about number of children who have not frequented primary school education from 2000 to 2012. As can be seen from the chart, the great deal of children without access to primary school education was in Africa in 2000 (over 45 millions) where the number of girls was slightly higher than boys. Consequently, in 2012 we can observe that generally, the number of children declined to 18.2 and 14.5 millions respectively, that depicts a significant rise of children that access to primary school education. Additionally, we can see almost the same number of children without access primary education in South Asia in 2000 (21.6 and 11.1 millions respectively). In contrast to Africa's data of 2012, South Asia shows that in 2012 it was a considerable rise of number of children who access primary education (4.8 and 5.1 millions respectively). Moving to the rest of world, it can be seen that during all period of time the number of student without acess to primary education was declined and almost equal number of both girls and boys access to primary school education in 2012.
