The graph illustrates how investment in renewable energy had altemed since 206 to 2013 in two types of countries and in worldwide. The overall trend is that investments reached the peak in 2011 through the whole and then slightly decreased. In 2006 the worldwide investment in energy was only $ 100 billions, $ 75 billions were made by developed countries and only $ 25 billions by developing countries. Since 2006 to 2008 the number of investigations rapidly grew and were estimated in $ 171 billions, but in 2008 the investment was stable for a year, with over $ 100 billions invested by developed countries and over $ 50 billions by developing countries. Then there was a huge increased in investment in energy and by 2011 worldwide investment reached a peak of $ 279 billions that contained over $ 175 billions of developed countries. The graph shows that since that time investment became smaller, with only $ 214 billions as a world total. To make comparison, should be said that during the whole period shown investments from developing countries were approximately a half of investment from developed countries, but by the end of 2013 they made a bit less $ 100 billions investment which is just a quarter less than investments made by developed countries.
