Today businesses of international companies are moved from developing countries to more poorer countries, also these international companies employ, local workers. From my perspective there are advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, if international companies will move their businesses to poorer countries, they can improve relationships between them (developing countries and poorer countries). The poorer countries do not have enough money for developing themselves businesses project, so they can get usefull information about thus. Also, I am absolutely convinced that if developing international companies move their business projects will be moved to poorer, they can a lot countries which can cooperation with them. On the another hand, not all poorer countries want to work for developing countries. Despite on that poorer countries do not have enough money for developing they have very beautiful places in their country. Sometimes the government of poorer country consider that foreign international developing companies can influence their environment. They consider that international companies move their new developing technology and it is has the bad influences for poorer countries. For example: global warming, problems with air pollutions and others. Has another problem with this, some many international companies can lose all. They must start from scratch in another country. In conclusion o would like to say that it is a bit difficult to predict I would probably say that if two countries can work together, of course, developing international companies can move their businesses to poorer, why not?
