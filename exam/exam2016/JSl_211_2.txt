In the modern world people spend much time to travel and trips are important part of our culture. Globalization and the technical progress gives to society a variety of possibilities of how and where to go. In XVIII century it was impossible to go to the America from Europe in one (or half) of a day, but nowadays one can just buy a ticket for a plane, departuing from Frankfurt - am - mein at 11.00, and at 23.00 - 24.00 he will be in some hotel in the eastern coach of USA. But of course there are some negative sides and one of them is a pollution, which leads to variety of problems. When all the positive and negative sides are considered, it can be written that I fully agree with established solution of their pollution problem. It is important to think about the world and how the next generations will love in it. And it is no doubt to think, that individual trip planning can be more important that the whole worlds health. There will be a lot of pluse if the law, reducing number of business and travel flights. Is worked out and taken by all countries. First of all, of course, the number of an air pollution will significantly decrease. The problem of global warming nowadays is very actual and the air pollution is one of the most important factors causing it, there is all reason to deal somehow with air pollution; and decreas the number of fights is good step. Secondly, the cost of flights will become lower because now civil aviation industry is in sutuation of "overflight" that means that many flights are taken half filled. If there will be full-filled airplanes companies will have possibility to reduce costs by cutting of unpopular ones and also decrease the ticket cost. But there is also one negative think which is waiting society if the low will be accepted - there will be less different times and travel planning will be not so variable s earlier.
