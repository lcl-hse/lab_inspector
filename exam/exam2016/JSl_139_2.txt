In the modern world there is the way for developing some international organizations. And this way consist of the idea to send their industry to developing countries. Such moving, of course, has their own benefits but not all people consider that there benefits outweigh the disadvantages. To my kind, the most important disadvantage of moving business to poorer countries is that people in developed countries can lost their job. It is obviously, that if in the country are falling the number of places for work, ther will be the growth of unemployed people. Moreover, the economic situation of developed countries can also changes in the worst way. I consider that such development of international companies has a lot of advantages. At first, it can be said that organizations include many benefits in the economy of developing countries. For example, international companies provide with job a lot of local workers. At second, companies avoid the waste of money because they don't need to pay local workers too much like it can be in their developed countries. And finally, there is a really important advantage of this process for customers: the price of product is getting less. For example, many famous brands of parfume have their industry not only in developed countries, but in developing too. And the price for example, for Chanel parfume from Malaysia will be really less than the price for Chanel parfume from France. To sum up, moving of business to poorer countries has their own pros and cons. As for me, the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages. But every president of international company decides what is better for his or her organization.
