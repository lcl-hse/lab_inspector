As we can see the huge amount of children both 23,7 millions of girls and 20 millions of boys in Africa could not study in primary school in 2000. But this amount decreased in 2012 to 14,5 millions of boys and 18,2 millions of girls. In the comparison, in South Asia in 2000 there was equal amount of people, which had not access to primary school.

In the addition, in Rest of World, almost all children could have primary education. For example, in 2000 only 12,6 millions of girls and 10,5 millions of boys did not study at primary school. In 2012 this amount became less. 
To conclude, Africa had the biggest amount of children, who could not learn subjects at school.
