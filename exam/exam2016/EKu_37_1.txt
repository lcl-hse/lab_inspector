The charts that are represented in the task illustrate how men and women tended to use the social network Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and the reasons for using it. To begin with, it can be seen from the first chart that in March 2012 it was more popular to connect to the Facebook via the computer (approximately 150 million of users chose that way of connection in 2012 and 130 million used the computer in 2013). Moreover, it should be mentioned that the use of mobile phone's Facebook app increased significantly in March 2013 in comparison with March 2012 (90 million of users in 2013 and 50 million of users in 2012). If we look at the second chart, we can understand that women preferred using Facebook more than men in order to share photos/videos with friends, relatives, to see funny posts in different groups. They also used Facebook in an educational way - to learn about ways to help others. As for the men, I should mention that they also enjoyed sending different files to their friends, but fewer than women (39% in comparison with 54%). Both men and women tended to use Facebook in order to receive updates from their relatives, friends and so on. To conclude, I assume that Facebook has become more popular nowadays than it was in the past. Furthermore, the reason for using this network depends on the sex of a person. And as we live in the age of technologies, more and more users today enjoy using telephones rather than computers to connect to the Facebook.
