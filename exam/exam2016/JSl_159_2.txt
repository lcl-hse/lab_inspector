There are many problems in our world, which can't be resolved by governments of countries only and for dealing with some of them other powers are also required. One of this issue is the lack of jobs in developing countries. Due to this fact, many international companies are trying to help and move their business to poorer, developing countries, starting to employ local workers. This situation has advantages and disadvantages, which will be discussed. Firstly, it can be advantage, because today we have lots of migrants from developing and poor countries, who come to developed countries for getting a good job or searching for a better life. One to the fact they are unemployed in these countries, they started to commit forbidden things, such as robbery, terroristic attacs and so on. For example, we can remember latest events on the territory of Brussel's airport, where two bombs exploaded. Although, there are some advantages in the moving businesses to the rural areas, it still has some disadvantages. The first one thing in the lack of education which has people in those countries, due to tha fact of inability to have a good education system. That's why workers in developing countries can't work at the same level as employees at developed countries are. Due to this fact, the company can lose it's prestige and it's income. In the same way the business in these countries may be can't be appropriate for these countries due to the discrepancy between though of people from countries of different level. In conclusion, I should say, that I think, that advantages of this development overweight disadvantages, because the constant developing of world required many countries to be developed and succed in different sides of life. Actually, it can be also be viewed in economic and educational of the country later, when it can be compared with developed countries.
