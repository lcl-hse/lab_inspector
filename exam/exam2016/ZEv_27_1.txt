The chart illustrates changes in number of youngsters not attending primary school from 2000 to 2012, divided by gender and region. First, it is absolutely clear that number of children without access to primary education has dramatically decreased throughout the years, especially in South Asia, where the chart demonstrates two-time decrease for boys (11,1 to 5,1 million of children) and over four-time reduction for girls (from 21,6 million to 4,8 million). The development of education in Africa, according to the chart, is not that fast, compared to South Asia, there is a slight change: 27,5% fall for boys (20 million to 14,5 million) and less than 50% for girls (23,7 million girls in 2000 to 18,2 in 2012). However, performance of Africa is still beter than overall dynamics around the world: "Rest of World" column of the chart shows least decrease of all three: neither boys or girls numbers haven't changed even for 50%. Therefore, the numbers are 12,8 to 7,6 for girls and 10,5 to 7,7 for boys. In conclusion, it is clear that South Asia demonstrates the most radical change, then it is Africa with far worst numbers and the last is "Rest of World" with slightly less decrease.
