The bar charts demonstrate the changes in the amount of children who do not have access to primary education. The chart includes the period of 12 years (from 2000 to 2012) in Africa, South Asia and the Rest of World, dividing children by gender. 
The most striking feature is that Africa seems to be a leader with its approximately 44 millions of children in 2000th. It is obvious that more girls than boys are not allowed to be educated all in all. In 2012 still about 30,6 million girls have not access to primary schools. 
It is important to say that South Asia has successfully overcome the problem: the number of uneducated children decreased from 33 to only 10 millions in past 12 years. Moreover, South Asia destroyed the gender discrimination in educational sphere, because in 2012 the percentage of girls and boys is almost 50 to 50. Overall, the main trend is decreasing a number of children without pimary education all over the world.
