In modern world the majority of people use social networks for different purposes. Some to share information, while others for entertaing.

Of course, there are not only drawbacks of sharing information and knowledge in Facebook or VK. Getting the information becomes much easier. Users can upload their essays or homeworks and post them on the wall, so their friends will be able to check it and help. Many newspapers have official pages, where they post hotnews. It enables users, who are subscribed, to be the first who read the news. Although, Facebook and Vkontakte have lots of information for sending, it also has entertaining content, such as music, films and games. This content gives a chance to users to spend time playing games with your friends or watching new film with family.
