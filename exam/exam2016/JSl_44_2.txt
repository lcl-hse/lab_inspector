Nowadays, travelling around the world is one of the most popular way to spend holidays or weekend. It is apparent that with the help of airplane people have an opportunity to reach particularly every place in the world. However, some people find it dangerous, because airplanes pollute our environment, and want government to reduce the number of air travel. I believe that air companies should be concerned about this situation and try to find solution. First of all, government may insist on air companies to pay for extent amount of flights. There should be a particular number of flights that companies may do without a fee, but if amount of air travel are much more considerable within one company, it will cost an additional payment. Secondly, air companies should use ecologically less damaging airplanes and fuel. Moreover, if the period of usage of some airplane is over, it must be immediately changed for a new and ecologically safe aircraft. Furthermore, government should suppose those companies which try to change a situation with air pollution in a good way by using ecologically safe materials. All in all, the problem in question is the subject of much debate. I am conviensed that should be environmentalists in the government to catch up with the causes of air pollution and global warming and prevent them.
