The given chart provides the comparison of the number of children with no abilities to have primary education between Affrica, South Asia and the Rest of World in years 2000 and 2012. According to the chart, the African region was the leader for boys and girls without access to primary schools in both years. Whereas South Asia had a rapid decrease since 2000 from 21,6 millions years and 11,1 millions boys to 4,8 mln and 5,1 mln respectively in 2012. That was less than the numbers in the rest of world in 2012. The proportion between girls had no overall pattern of increase or decrease, rather the figures show the downward trend during the period in the whole world. The only exception was the number of girls in South Asia which fall four times since 2000. Overall, the data indicates that here were sharp changes in the number of boys and girls without access to primary education during the period of 12 years. Even though, South Asia cut down its numbers noticeably (from 32,2 mln of uneducated children to 9,9 mln), Africa had not solved this problem yeat.
