The provided diagram illustrates changes in the amount of children who had not got access to primary school education during the period from 2000 to 2012. 
First of all, it can be clearly seen that 20 millions of boys and 23,7 millions of girls, who lived in Africa in 2000, had not got access to primary education. But this situation has changed by the end of the period. 5.5 millions of boys and the same amount of girls had not got access to primary schools in 2012. In South Asia the number of children without access to primary education was lower. In 2000 11,1 millions of boys 21,6 millions of girls were illiterate. These numbers dropped dramatically. And by the end of the period only 5,1 millions of Asian boys and 4,8 millions of Asian girls did not study in primary schools.
