Nowadays, people all over the world spend so much time sitting in Facebook and Vkontakte. However, what is the main purpose of social media. Some argue that social networks are used mostly for sharing information and knowledge while others believe that it is just entertainment. In this essay I would like discuss both these points and give my own opinion. On the one hand, in the world of internet some people use social media for finding information or giving necessary one because is easily to contact everybody through Facebook or Vkontakte. Developers of these networks invented such great application that allow us to receive messages in seconds and send them. Moreover, most companies, even universities have their own page in every network because of its accessability for target audience. On the other hand people often us Internet only just for entertainment. In Vkontakte most messages are sent just for fun or the information received is not valuable. Also such services are used by some companies just for advertising and creating a buzz. In conclusion, it should be mentioned that everybody needs to decide what his/her purpose of using any social media is and how to use it effectively according to that need. I personaly agree with the statement which indicates that the main purpose social networks is simply to entertain rather than to after valuable information.
