Nowadays travelling became the most popular way of time-speaking because of a lot of opportunities but at the same time it is a big issue for people to level off the air pollution. 
Inspite of the fact that plans damage the atmosphere this type of transport has many benefits. First of all, plans are the fastest transport in the world. It helps businessmen to communicate with partners around the world and to visit different countries in the limited time. Secondly, air transport is very safety. That is why people prefer plans to cars, because it can avoid traffic and accidents. It allows people to make business in different parts of country or even of a world. Thirdly, many people prefer countries to travel which are far from home and it is difficult to visit it by train. 
Another question is that plans may be cause of global warming and air pollution. The main reason is that plans are made of alluminium which can destroy the atmosphere. Moreover, the materials which use during the building of the plane are also very dangerous for Earth. Futhermore, in recent years the number of terrosism in air is extremely growing and many airports were ocupating by extremists. 
Taking all the resons mentioned above into consideration, I would like to say that plans are the most convinient and the most popular means of transport and it should defenetly continue to work, but government should discuss the measures to reduce the pollution. May be they should add and discover the other variants of transportation or, for example, develop the land and water transport system to make them more comfortable and accessable for people all over the world.
