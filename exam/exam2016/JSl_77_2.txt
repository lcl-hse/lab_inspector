It is widely said that there is an increased tendency of moving international companies' business to non-developed countries, which is followed by employment of local workers. Under any curcumstances, such strongly tends to be quite efficient and non-practical, which could be provided with the arguments below. To begin with, each policy in a sphere of worldwide business is utterly unfriendly to developing countries' ecology. In 21st century factor of pollution becomes extremely crutial, and every company, moving it's factories abroad should not only be concerned about it, but also to be ready to cope with difficulties and results of such actions. By the date one of the most impressive examples is an ecological situation of China's regions, which have become a landers of German, French and other countries factories' and which already have caused numerous problems, threatening an ozon layes, seas clarity and soil state not only inside China's boarders, but all over the world. However, income makes people forge not only about some materialistic things like level of pollution, but also about ethics. Numerous ethnical features have been destroyed by growth of industry, all over the world, many unique tribes have lost their living places, many languages will never sound on or planet anymore due to human greed and vigor to have more money. An example of that is a story of Pocahontas, which have been taking place in North America in 17th century, while these lands were conquered by Europeans, and this have become a huge threat to local Indians. All in all, today economical reasons are dictating their own rules in policy, but the harm of its consequences should make us think about whether it is important enough or not and we should decide: will we still want to be rich if there would be no place to live and no one to share this perk.
