Nowadays, air travelling has become a popular mean of transport, as it fast, comfortable and save. However, there are also many advantages in using planes. So what is the best way, to use plane often or to try to avoid it? 
I think Planes is one of the greatest invention ever. First of all, It saves time. What is utmost important for businessmen. Secondly it is save, as accidents happen very seldom. Then, there are such destinations which hard to reach by means of transport. For example the way from Moscow to Washington takes 13 hours travelling by air, at the same time it would take a couple weeks to go there by trains and ship. 
Nevertheless it is clear that air pollution by planes is significant. They consume a huge amount of fuel and then emit it in the air. The damage from which the environment suffers is great and the most essential point is that we can't fix it. 
I think that the solution may be found easily. The governments should ban all air travels for short distances. At the same time they have to develop introstructures for example, make trains to go faster or to buid roads for speed moving. 
In conclusion I would like to say, that plane is a good mean of transport and it should not be prohibited at all. We must find ways to use planes more seldom to save our planet Earth.
