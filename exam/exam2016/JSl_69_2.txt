Currently lots of international companies are moving their businesses to poorer developing countries and employing local workers. And there are some advantages and disadvantages of this process. Firstly, in developing countries the wages are usually lower than in developed countries that means that international companies can save a lot of money they employ local workers from that countries. Secondly, it is always cheaper to rent the land of building for your business needs in the developing countries. The prices there are not as high as in developed countries. And finally this is a very good and kind thing to help citizens of developing country to find a job. In that countries it is a very difficult, because it's population is usually high and its production is in a very bad conditions to give that people so many work places. There also some disadvantages of moving bussiness to poorer countries. Firstly, even if you move your business in the developing county, you definitely left the head office in your country. So it could provide some problems with involved in your bussiness may not agree to move in the developing country. In that case you will have several problems with the manager force. Having a conclusion, I would like to say that inspite of moving businesses to poorer, developing countries and employ local workers has several disadvantages they are not so important and can be easily solved. So, I think that the advantages of this development definitely outweigh the disadvantages.
