It is not a secret that many business companies start to open new offices in poor countries to help people from these to find work. Some people believe that it can improve situation in developing countries, while others claim that there are disadvantages than benefits. I strongly believe that international companies give helping hand and do q good deal for all world this way, I can name only one cons despite many positive sides. To begin with, many countries suffer from pack of work places. People have to work on low salary job to feed their family. Big companies found a solution and give opportunity to work in comfortable conditions with career growth. For example, Valio factories in Russia. They were opened by finnish businessmen and helped many Russians to find work, moreover this improvement increased quality of milk products in our country. Another main benefit of moving businesses to poorer countries is innovations which new employees can create. All shereas of business need changings and transformation. New clear brains of workers from developing countries can really bring significant achievements to their bosses. Fresh ideas cannot only help in business profit but it make people to be proud for their succeses. I read about psychological factor of developing business in one book, and the author said that poor workers usually try to be usefull for them employeres more than other workers. There is only one disadvantage of this development big amount of money and time, which companies should spend on moving their business. But this is just a small problems, compared with all benefits.
