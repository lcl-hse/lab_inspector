Air travel has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. In my opinion, air travel is inevitable and because of it the government should not introduce some laws or something like that to decreas air travel. The first advantage is that our century is century of technical progress. Our lifes become quicker and most of us hasn't got any free time. Thanks for air travel we cannot only safe our time, but also it allows us to achieve to our destination in safety. To my mind, it is very important part. The second argue is that even if the government introduce some laws which increase air travel and in conclusion help to reduce air polution, this burning issue will always be in our lives. Of course, we should take into consideration that our ecological situation now is in dangerous but we also should understand that the problem will not solve, even there is no planes at all. The third argue is that anouther transports also have a great damage to our enviromental. For example, car's gasses has a lot of bad influence especially in megapolises. In conclusion, I want to stress that every point of view is important and justified but my point of view, that government should not introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel, seems to me the most convenient. Because nowadays air planes becomes part of our lives.
