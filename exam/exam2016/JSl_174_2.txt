There is a common situation in modern world, when big international organizations made decision to expand their business in a developing countries. They open their companies in a poorer countries and employ people who live there. There is a set of advantages and disadvantages on this topic. The first advantage I see in this situation is that there are a lot of working places and vacancies for people, who can't find a job because of some economy crisis, for example. That is definetly a huge plus to developing countries with a poor people. But here goes a disadvantage too. Since there are much people, who willing to get a job in a famous international company, the stakeholders might to use a chip work force, and conditions in that company may be awful and payment is low, but people has nothing to do with this. Other advantage is that the more such companies is moving in country, the country tend to develop more. For example, if international company produce some food, this brand of food products will appear in this country, so not only local workers but other people too can buy new things. The supply om local market becomes wider. Also, there is another disadvantage, though it may be not so obvious. The building a large new factory in a new place can lead to environmental pollution. Moreover, this factory can take someone's home and the government of developing country would not pay attention to this, because it is a good chance for the. All in all, it is a different topic to discusse. But I think that advantages of such development outweigh the disadvantages. This expanding brings development not only to poorer country, but to a business too.
