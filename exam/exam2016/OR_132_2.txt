It goes without saying that nowadays children spend less time with both mother and farther because parents have to work in order to earn money for family. It is not surprising but in the past children spend more time with their parents. To my mind, there are some reasons for this. Firstly, parents work a lot because they want to give the education to their children and try t provide them all important things. Secondly, in the past the situation was not the same because there were not so many opportunities for work, past generation was given definitely job and place. Moreover, now we live in the world of big consumption where it is very difficult to live if you don't have enough money. It is worth adding that his situation cause a lot of problems which every family has to tackle in order to improve the relationships in family an live in the harmony without any misunderstanding. Moreover, the main problem is obvious, parents and children don't communicate a lot with each other, they begin to argue because they don't understand the situation. Also, children in such families are living alone, parents don't support them due to the lack of time. In conclusion, I would like to say that as one of the famous saying goes, "So many men, so many minds". But I strongly believe that both parents and their children have to solve this problem. For example, it is an excellent idea to spend a lot of time together when parent have day-off. Unfortunately, some parents avoid such chances and prefer more important things for them instead of spending time with the family.
