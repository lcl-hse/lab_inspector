Air travels become the very important thing for modern people. Business trips travels to other countries to rest, international conferences, travels to meet your friends and families need fast transports as airplane. But some people says that airplane contribute to air pollution and can be a reason at global warming. 
The most important argument of the group that positively relation to airplanes is that airplanes does not have substituts by speed. A man can be delivered in everywhere for 24 hours when other transport. Can require more. And it the government will introduce the law to reduce the amount of air travel, the price of air tickets will increase ad it increases cost for business it will effect to business climate in the country that is country will become more isolated. And it will negatively effect to education, culture, science etc. 
In the other hand, air travel contributes to air pollution, and this is a reason of global warming. This group says that clear air and good climate are more important than effect said other group. They say that business important too, but great business are unimportant without good ecology. 
In the end, I think that thr government should give subsidies to development technology to decrease airplanes air pollution. And this is the most right decision.
