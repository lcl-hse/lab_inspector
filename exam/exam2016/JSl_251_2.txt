Today the world in facing a lot of environmental problems and the air pollution is considered to be one of most severe threads to human beings and nature. A lot of people believe that air travel for business and leisure should be cut in order to reduce the pollution, while others do not think that there is such need. While my opinion is concerned, I suppose that governments should not restrict travelling in any ways. To begin with, air travel is considered one of the most means of travelling so that it would be unkind to force people to use buses, trains etc. instead. Moreover, by majority of people airplanes are thought to be most fast, cheap and comfortable way to visit countries. Finally, there are such professions that require to travel on regular or even constant basis. However, many enthusiasts share a point of view that such government policy would greatly contribute to nature protection. The main idea is that people should take all the possible steps to defend the planet and well-being of next generations. In conclusion, it should be emphasized that although the humanity has to fight global warming, air pollution and other nature disasters, the measures taken have to be rational and based on the science as, for example, prices or tax policy.
