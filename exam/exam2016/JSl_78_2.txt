In todays world more and more big businesses are tend to be replaced to developing countries where the majority of employees are local people. This change brings a lot of advantages for the "host" countries as well as disadvantages. The main advantage of such a development is that international companies contribute to the economic development of poorer country by creation of new working places, which brings people the opportunity to earn more money and so that improve their living conditions get a better education and so on. In addition, the product produced in the host country is much more cheaper than the same one from another country, so more people afford to buy it. Another important advantage of this trend is that developing country learn new technology and culture from the international company. For instance, Japan managed to not only copy the European technology but create its own unice products. However, there are also some negative aspects of the process. One of them is ecological problems, such as air and water pollution. It is not a secret that sometimes big international companies more durty businesses. On the territory of poorer countries which has an adverse environmental effect on the nearest ecosystem. For example, a huge territory in Tianjiny, China is boldy polluted by factories owned by international companies, who consider themselves not responsible for the problem. Another disadvantage is that enormous sum of money are removed from the "host" country to the " mother" country of the business, so that sometimes the "host" country gets nothing from such a business. All in all, I think that the advantages of money business to developing countries overwhelmed the disadvantages.
