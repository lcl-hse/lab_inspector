Air pollution and global warming in some degree are results of air travels. 
Some people thought that actual number of flights is too much and there are a place for decreasing it is. Of course, sten ntigts found enough proofments for this position and we should agree with them. 
First of all, if we go to the airport we will see many different types of air planes. There could be Airbuses, Bongs or planes produces by another company which were invited twenty, thirty or fourty years ago. This planes were produced with out dated technologes which don't match to nowadays ecological standarts. Founding on this argument governments should increase the rate of taxes for flights on old planes and then submit the money that they will collect to recovery of wild. 
In other side governments should creates specially rest ones for citizens in every rgion to reduce number of flight to resort areas because there are no chances to stop business flights. 
In many situation, not only air travel is a rease of air pollution. People's activity under and on the growth making more serious problems to ecology, besides it, every party of human's activity should have an adequate analyze and in first we should began to redusing pollution from the most dangerous sectors for ecology.
