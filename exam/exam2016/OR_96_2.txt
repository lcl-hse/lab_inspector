There is no doubt that aircrafts significantly conduce to air pollution and formation of ozon holes. Some people are sure that planes should be limited to use by population and business. However others are sure that such measures are not expected to be effective. To my mind, I totally disagree with proponents of air travel reduction. First of all, modern jet is rater faster than ship or train and can deliver passengers of cargo without the necessity to change transport type. For instance, ship is not able to reach the country which has only land boundaries as well as train could not cross the Atlantic ocean. Secondly, there are sorts of products that have extremely short life expectancy what makes plane only appropriate kind of transport for this type of goods. Another point to be made that other types of transport contribute to global warming at least at the same level. It is just enough to remind about oil withrawels from tankes what occur regularly in the Persian gulf. There is another opinion whose adepts are strongly sure that expand and development of private flights is of the main causes of global warming and air pollution. They are in favour of reducal of civil air travelling because the share of air travel for business and leisure purposes is rather higher than state one. Moreover, they are convinced that development of more environmentally friendly engines would not solve the problem because of technological differences between automobile and plane engines. Though I agree with this opinion only up to a point I would rather restrain myself in other needs than to refuse from air travel. To sum up, I want to state that air travel is not the only one cause of air pollution and I wish environmentalist to concentrate on other pollutants instead of violating right for freedom in movement.
