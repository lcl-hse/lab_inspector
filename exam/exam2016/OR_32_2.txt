Nowadays many families from millennium generation have both working parents and their children see parents less time that the older generation. There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages about it and I am going to show these. To begin with, the reasons of spending less time parents with children in development of education and increasement of job competition, therefore many "millennium" people want to have financial safety and successful carcer. In addition, feminists opened this opportunity for women and many woman have job nowadays. That is why both parents work and do not sit with their children. It can be dangerous for kids, first of all, because kids spend time with internet, their environment, for example with othe kids on dangerous occasions. Secondly, the child can have psychological problems without parents' communication, he can close the door to other people in his soul. However, many people see advantages of this. For example, children can be more serious with others or can find decisions in hard life situations. To sum up, children' psychological state depends on their parents. If parents control their time, everything is be alright.
