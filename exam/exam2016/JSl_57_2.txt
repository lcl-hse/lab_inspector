Currently, a huge amount of successful international companies build their brandies in the developing countries or even more to these areas. From my point of view it gives a great opportunity for local people to work for these companies because there is an employment problem in poor countries. Also, starting working in a big international company makes these people learn something new, especially about culture and life of developed countries, which can possibly rapid the process of development of their motherland. Of coure, there are a lot of advantages not only for locals, but for founders of the international business too. Salaries in developing countries are less than huge wages in developed ones, so the expenditures are lower. The same situation is with the land cost. As in the poor countries there are just a few companies and cities, there is a wide land to build new factories, companies, centers and develop them, expanding the territory they occupy. Nevertheless, one should accept that there is one big disadvantage of moving business to poor countries, that can influence all the local in a bad way and make them want to prevent people from developed countries to build something on their land. This disadvantage is high level of contamination. Businessmen who think of moving their companies to poor areas usually don't consider about spending a lot of money or filters or other pollution - preventing machines. So it is harmful for the environment of the country and not so dramatical for the expenditures of the businessmen. For example, some companies in Japan do such movement - they move their factories to poor Asian countries to prevent pollution in their own country. In my opinion, this disadvantage outweigh all the advatages because it is not fair, concerning people of developing countries.
