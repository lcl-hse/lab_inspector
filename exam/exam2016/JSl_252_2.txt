There are many environmental problems at our time. Especially, problems like air pollution and global warming. In our world we cannot without air travel but this type of transport has many disadvantages. To begin with, I would like to say that planes pollute atmosphere because only engine that introduce oil to fly pollute oxygen such reagents like 2O and H2O. but we cannot do anything with this. Also people need to fly because it is a very convenient way of transport. From pluses we can add that we move faster appearance at other place when we could not to get on car or train. This transport have done our life easily and more comfortable. New people that cannot be theirs family for years can do this if they had some time and money for flying. We live in industrial world and each men must know that our atmosphere will not forever be clean and fresh. That's why government of each country must introduce laws to air travel companies there they will not sue bad oil to engine. Actually, I think that director of air trance company must do special programmes that will clean reagents from plants. If this programme will work that must be helpful to atmosphere. To sum up, I often use air travel because I am not from Moscow and my native city is about 3000 km. I cannot use other transport like train or bus because it is inconvenient and you will pay more money to get to your home. That's why I partly agree with point of view that governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business.
