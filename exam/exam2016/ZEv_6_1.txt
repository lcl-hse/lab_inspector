The bar chart illustrates amount of children who were not allowd to attend pryimary school in South Asia and Africa from 2000 to 2012. There were two reasons for this occasion - region and gender. Overall, it is obvious that the number of these children has reduced twice during the years. 
Firstly, we should pay attention to 2000. The biggest percentage is connected with Africa. There are about 44 millions of children (20 millions of boys and 23,7 millions of girls). In the same time in South Asia the number of girls is approximately equal (21,6 millions). It is not reveal to amount of boys (11,1 millions). 
The next period of time, which was analysed is 2012 year. It is a great progress in South Asia. The number reduced more than in 3 times (from 33 millions to 10). About 6 millions among both African boys and girls got a permission to have a primary school education. 
Overall, the rest of world has not reduced very much during 12 years. Gender and region problems are still exist in such areas as Africa. In 2012 there were about 16 millions children, but in 2000 about 24. That is why we can see a good progress.
