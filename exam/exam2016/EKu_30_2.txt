Nowadays the total crime rate is considerably higher in comparison with the previous periods. There are a lot of ideas offered to reduce the amount of crime, but some of them are really controversial. Does it worth to concentrate on the period of prisoning or other measures should be undertaken? Some people tend to assume that the total crime rate can be fastly reduced by giving longer prison sentences. First of all, they consider that longer periods of time can make a psychological influence on crimunals. Therefore, the responsibility is higher and not everyone wants to pass his or her life in prison. Secondly, the fear of being emprisoned makes the authority the government and law, that is why people feel theis duties and responsibility for their thoughts and things they do. Thirdly, the risk of the second crime commitment declines considerably. But there is another point of view. Some people think that there should be other ways of crime reduction. To begin with, longer prison sentences are not always effective: some people do not have any fear or responsibilities. Moreover, other methods have to be included, such as makinf a new law background or making the law less restricted. Higher taxes can be one of the best ways to reduce the crime. In addition, people are influenced by media, that is why changing the media content can be an effective way to deal with crime. This is because the crime is commited always beacause of psychological problems. To sum up, we can influence on total crime rate by some methods, but the main is - to work with people's minds. Personally I believe that in the future we will deal with it.
