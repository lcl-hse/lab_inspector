In the todays world there is tendency of lots of businessmans moving their factories to countries of the third world and using work of local people. The question is would this movement bring more benefits or harm to the word. I personally tend to believe that moving the majority of factories to the developing countries has more cans than pros. Firstly, it makes it very difficult for local business to develop because of strong concuration they face. Secondly, the employers often pay minimum of money to the local workers just because they have no alternative work; companies are not concerned with the education of workers or either their carier growth which makes it hard to people to survive in case of flossing the factory, where they are working. Although, some people think that production of goods in developing countries by international companies is beneficial. Main argument for this position is that this moved businesses provide lots of working places for local people and by this they are helping to economics of host countries to develop. Secondly, it should not be forgotten that by using cheap working resourses of developing countries it is possible for salers to produse cheap and available goods for everyone, without losing the quality of products. All in all, there are two different points of view on the problem of the moving business to the developing countries. I strongly believe that it will bring more harm, but surely it has some benefits.
