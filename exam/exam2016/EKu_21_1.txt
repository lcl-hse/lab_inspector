The diagram given in the task illustrates the use of Facebook during the period from 2012 to 2013 and why do men and women use Facebook. The first bar chart, which illustrates the use of the social net, shows, that at the whole, users are more prone to connect to Facebook via desktop rather than mobile. Nevertheless, we can see a tend to decrease for the number of desktop users(from about 150 millions in March 2012 to a little bit more than 130 millions in March 2013) and for mobile users to increase in number(from about 60 millions in March 2012 to almost 100 millions in March 2013). The second figure reveals next tendencies: among women the most important reason for using Facebook is sharing photos and videos: 54% of women thought it was the main reason. For men the reason was as important as receiving updates - the latter was equally important for both men and women(39% for each). A little bit less important had seeing funny posts and the last one was learning about ways to help others. So, as we can see Facebook seems to be an important resource for communicating and it becomes more portable than it was before.
