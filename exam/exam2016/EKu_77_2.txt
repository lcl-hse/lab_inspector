Nowadays more and more people are involved in discussions about the crime. It seems obviously that law breakers must be punished. There are different ways of reducing crime level, but some of the methods can be not effective. Some people believe that staying in prisons for a longer time can dramatically help reduce the crime level. To begin with, living in prisons make law breakers to think over their behaviour and the punishment they got and make a desicion to become later lovers of the lows and good citizens. In addition, if law breakers are in prisons, the society will not suffer from new crime commited them, because being in prisons they have not a chance to commit recedive crime acts for people who are freedome. Moreover, longer prison periods can be helpful in preventing crime levels, because some people can be frightened by this way of punishment. On the other hand some people consider, that alternative methods of dropping crime level are more helpful. Firstly, they suppose that killing law breakers allow to avoid recedive crime acts and give an effective example for those who only plans to commit a crime. Secondly,making law breakers work in a hard way as drivers, cleaners or etc. without any payment can help government both reduce the crime level and not to spend money for prisons. Thirdly, it is believed that social advertisement like short fims where negative effects of crime acts are explained is a good way to reduce crime, because media materials have a greate impact on the all people. In conclusion, it can be stated that there are varies of ways of decreasing crime and all of them have their benefits and disadvantages at the same time. Personally, I believe that giving longer prison punishment is a good method, however other ways are also necessary to make reducing crime level more effective.
