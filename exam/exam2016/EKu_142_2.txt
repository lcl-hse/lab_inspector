Nowadays internetional componies tend to move their businesses to developing countries and suggest local people to work there. I will try to consider the isssue in what ways developing countries benefit from that and in what ways they don't. To begin with, poor countries benefit a lot from having international companies offices in there. Firstly, it is a good solution to problems with unemployment, those companies provide local people with working places. Secondly, it helps countries to develop faster. Nevertheless, international companies prevent the local businesses from development, the competition with big componies sometimes is unbearable. That can cause the situation in what selfexpression for lacal people is nearly impossible. In conclusion, the question whether it is good that international companies move their businesses to poorer countries or not is widely debated. That can cause both solution of the unemloyment problem and the lack of selfexpression opportunities for local people.
