Nowadays, criminalism is a very important topic and also a problem. People always try to isolate criminalists from a society. However, what we really should do? Of course, prisons are a good way to isolate robers killers and maybe n increasing of prison sentences will really reduce crime. Nevertheless, what if the person is not a serial killer or somebody like that but only a small robber. Maybe this person just tried to feed his family. In my opinion, in that case, a longer prison sentence will only increase an opportunity that this person will do a crime again. Of course, people should solve not only consequences of crime, but also work with its reasons. Governments should help crimers. Of course, not everybody can change himself, but I believe that most of people can do it and understand that crimes it is not good and it is really harmful for a society and that everybody should think only about himself. Programs of changing criminalists I think one of the most right way of solving problem, but it is really hard. Another way is to enforce police and other similar infrastructurs. This way of solving problem is much more easier to make, but it will not solve the problem completely. Of course, it will give good results in the beginning stages but the future is unpredictable. All in all, it is very hard to say what is more useful to the for reducing crime. Maybe we should use different combinations of different programs and only with that we will can to achieve our goal.
