A lot of people are sure that the most efficient method to reduce crime is to increase duration of prison sentences. However, others hope that are anothers ways to reduce crime, and these ways are make efficient. I agree with both sentences. First of all, it cannot be denied that giving longer prison sentences will reduce crime, because the people who going to do illegal action, will more afraid consequenses. However, according to statistic, the majority, who have been in prison, will break law again with large probability. For instance, in Russia, a perecent of recediensts is about 90% it is evidence, that the better way is to discourage people break law. The issue is what this way is. Ther are several approaches to solve it. The first one is make life condictions better by doing this people will have less reasons to break law, and so the crime will reduce. For example, the government may give better help for people who have differenties with their health, wealth and family. The second one, the mass media may make sure people in dangerouse of crime, in awful consequences, in psychologic sufficinets and others. Thus, people will suggest a risk of breaking law else, and then they will do this less frequently as before. I think, that the crime level can be reduced because of efforts of government, citizens and mass media.
