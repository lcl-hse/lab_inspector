The bar chart provides information on how many children didn't have access to primary education by gender and region, comparing year 2000 and year 2012. 
At first glance it can be seen that interestingly, in most of the regions there are more girls without access to primary education than boys. For example in South Asia 2000 the number of girls is almost twice the number of boys, even though the situation dramatically changed in the year 2012 as there are now 5.1 mil of boys and 4.8 mil of girls, which are about the same. 
Another thing about South Asia is that on overall in the year 2012 there are nearly three times less children without primary education then in the year 2000. This tendency is time to other regions, however the decrease in numbers in Africa and the rest of the world is not as big: only about a quater in both pairs of bars. 
As of an overall and final observation, it is true to say that, regardless of the year we are looking at, the rest of the world always has less children without access to primary education in summary, than Africa and South Asia.
