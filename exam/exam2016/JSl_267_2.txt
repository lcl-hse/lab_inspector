It is believed that such social media as Facebook, Vkontakte or Twitter are used just for entertaining people all around the world. However, other people think that such social networks can easily be a great source of information. In this essay I will try to express my own opinion and support it with arguments and examples. First of all, it is common knowledge that social networks are the greate source of information which people can easily use. For example, Facebook or Vkontakte has a great number of users from different countries, of different beliefs. So, you can ask them questions, get interesting information from them or even argue with them. It means that you can get experience and knowledge just from people. Secondly, such social media as Vkontakte has a lot of publications which people can easily download from it, usually it is free. Moreover, you can post your publication and share your information or knowledge. The great examples is Twitter where people just share their views and discuss variants problems. Although there is another point of view. Other people say that the main pupose of social networks is just to entertain users. They argue that such social medias are filled by entertaining content which cannot give you any useful information. They also say that most of the information is not true. So you should not trust it and use in your course work, for example. To sum up, I suppose that social media is a hard topic to discuss. But it is hard to underestimate it's role in our live. And I think it can be both the source of information for people and the source with a great amount of entertaining content fro users. So, it depends or preferences of a particular user.
