Here we have the chart shows as the level of access to primary school education for twelwe years in different regions. Gender is also a significant for the chart. In Africa in 2000 almost 45 million children did not have a possibility to get primary education. More than half of these children were girls. After 2 years this level reduced, more children could go to school both genders. It shows growing tendency to equality and educational development. Despite the fact that number of children without access to primary education on Africa continiues to be really high. The most significant and rapid changes were in South Asia. Gender equality in education sphere and level of access to school education sphere and level of access to school education more increased in 5 times for girls and 2 times for boys. Rest of world gradually reduces the negative factors and 10 more million children could afford to get primary education. Moreover, half from these are girls. All in all, we can say that horrible number have a strong tendency to reduced by government and programms, so we hope all children of the world could access to primary education in any region and both genders.
