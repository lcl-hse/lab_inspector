The diagram demonstrates the rate of children, who do not get their primary school education divided in groups by region and gender. The main trend is declining the number of children without education among all regions and both genders. It is clearly shown on the chart that the most significant decrease happened in South Asia, where the amount of non-educated children in 2012 cut more that 3 times comparing to 2010s' data. What is more, the diagram reports of success in gender equality: in 2010 there were 2 times more girls than boys without access to education, in 2012 the number is almost equial. The other regions are also showing positive dynamic. In Africa amount of non-educated children is decreasing, however, not so rapidly as it happen in South Asia. Situation with genders seems to be better in the Rest of World. Number of non-educated girls in 2012 is even less, than amount of boys. In conclusion, all regions are showing results in declining number of children without access to primary school education. It emphasise great progress of humanity.
