Nowadays air travel plays a crusial role in modern transportation because it saves the time a lot. Unfortunately, air travel contributes a lot to air pollution and global warming. That is why the government should make laws that will reduce the amount of air travel because not all of them are necessary. I personally believe, that this point is right and I support it. 
First of all, Europe has a very developed system of land transportation, the same is with underground transport. However, people prefer to have a flight because it saves some time for them. If the government cancels some flights they will have no choice but use land transport. 
Secondly, air travel pollutes the air and makes worse the situation of global warming. We can't ignore the fact that soon our Earth will have unchangeable consequences. If we can do something to change it we must make actions. 
Thirdly, our technologies develop very quick as we live in the era of modernization. So, I think that soon we will not spend on travelling from one continent to another more than 10 or 15 minutes. More important, I am sure that such kind of travelling will not pollute the environment because such transport will work at the alternative enerdy such as solar, wind and waves. For example, nowadays there are prototipes of automobiles that fly on eco-energy. Infortunately, such energy is not enough for long flights but scientists soon find the solution. 
On the other hand, at this time air travel play an important role in transporting between continents, as it takes more than few days to get to the destination and a lot of them are really dangerous. For example, nobody will argue that nowaday it is imporssible to get from Asia to America by the ocean. 
To sum up, I would like to say that we shouldn't cancel all the flights despite the fact that they pollute the atmosphere. However, the government can reduse the number of them because some people can comfortably use land transport such as trains or subways.
