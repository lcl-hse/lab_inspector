People have differing views with regard to the impact of the air transport on the natural environment as for me, I believe that airplanes do not pollute the air crucially, thus there is no necessaty to reduce the number of air travel in the world. On the one hand, nowadays there are significant climate changes on the Earth such as global warming which can have disasterous effect on people is lives. As it has been proven that air planes contribute to air pollution, companies should make special research programmes, in order to create an innovative, engine which will reduce the air pollution created by planes and other means of air transport. On the other hand, it can be seen that air travel is unnecessary in the modern world. At the same time, I disagree with people who think that nowadays the are a lot of unnecessary air travel. All the flight are useful and needed. For example, it is very difficult to go to another place by train or by bus if it is situated too far from here. Moreover, people usually try to arrive to the destination as soon as possible, thus they use air planes, which have a faster speed. In the addition, it governments impose taxes on air travel, it will lead to a great increases in prices of most of the goods, it can be noticed that it will have a negative impact especially on ordinary consumers. Moreover, if governments introduce laws in order to reduce the number of air travel, there will be a very long traffic jams on road through all over the world. It will increase the costs of delivery of goods. If ordinary people cannot travel by planes, they couldn't visit other countries which are located too far from they homes. In conclusion, I really believe that it is unnessary to impose taxes and special laws on air travel because the results of this can be crucial for ordinary people.
