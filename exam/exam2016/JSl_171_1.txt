The given picture illustrates the difference of international investments in renewable energy for the period from 2006 to 2013 either in developed and developing countries as well as in the world in total. Overall, we can see that the amount of invested money has gone up after the 7-years period. However, it is worth noting that the tendency changed in 2011, as for the two years till 2013 the investment started to decrease. Total worldwide investment graph shows that the investment in renewable energy doubled from 100 to 214. On the other hand, after reaching a peak, it faced a significant decrease after 2011 that changed the index for almost 70 points. If we take a look at bar charts representing data for developed and developing countries, we can notice that the amount of investment from developed countries is much more that from developing ones. The interesting fact is that when the worldwide's and developed countries' investment started to fall down in 2011, developing countries still were investing money in renewable energy for an additional year.
