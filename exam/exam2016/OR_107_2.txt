It is difficult to deny the fact that children spent more time with their parents in the past. Today relatives do not pay too much attention to child's spare time. I will discuss this trend and analyse the reasons for this. It is believed that many decades ago, women should not had a job, their dutys were householding, cooking and upbringing their children. However, nowadays womenkind try to earn their own money, to have a career success and promotion. It means that they do not have enough time to entertain their kids. Another reason can be an another relationship to child's spare time. Today parents think that children prefer the computer games or the Internet more, then spending time with their relatives. Moreover, it is very popular for busy parents to employ a babysitter of another person to spend leasure time with a child. So it can cause a lot of problems. For example, kids can used to this unknown woman or sometimes they start to argue with their parents as they "leave them". The main problem is children upbringing. If parents do not think about this, kids will choose their own way of spending leasure time, and sometimes it can be drinking with friends, smoking or spending too much time in front of the computer. So when parents spend a lot of time with their work, they can'not follow the child's upbringing. Moreover, sometimes it is difficult for young generation to live without parents attention and spending leasure time together. To conclude, child's leasure time without their parents can be a problem. However, if we know about the consequences of this, children will be happier.
