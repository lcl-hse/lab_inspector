The graph below illustrate number of children which don't get primary education. We see defenit period rfom 2000 to 2012. This children sorts on region and gender. 
On the graph we see that large amount boys and girls wish didn't get education in Africa. On 2000 years boys were 20 millions and girls were 23,7 millions and thogethe was 43,7 millions. The smolest number of children were in South Asia in 2012 year. This indicator shows that amount boys were 5,1 million and girls were 4,8 million. Also the graph illustrates that in Africa and South Asia was the same indicator but diferent years. Number of children which don't get the first education 34 millions on the both regions. In the end we see that amount children which didn't get education decrease with each years. I think it is good illustrate for all the world.
