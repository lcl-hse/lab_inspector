In this report I would like to write about the information given on the charts. Charts show how the usage of Facebook has changed and why people use it. As we can see on the first cart, people started using mobile version more in March 2013 (approximately 100 millions of users) than it was in march 2012 (approximately 60 millions of users). At the same time the usage of deskop verson decreased in March 2013 (approximately 140 millions of users). In March 2012 deskop version was used by approximately 150 millions of users. Second chart gives an information about reasons of using Facebook among men and women. As we can see, mostly all people think that the use Facebook because of sharing photos or videos (54% of women and 39% of men). The second and third reasons differ between men and women. As the second most popular reason 43% of women suppose that it is seeing funny posts, 38% of men think that it is receiving updates. As the third popular reason 39% of women choose receiving updates and 35% of men choose seeing funny posts. As for the last reason, all men(25%) and women(35%) choose learning about ways to help others. This ends my report.
