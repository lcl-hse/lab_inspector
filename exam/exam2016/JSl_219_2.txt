It is believed that air travel causes air pollution and global warming. Taking into account that it is no need in much air travel governments are expected to introduce laws which will decreased the number of business - trips by plane and air travel for leisure. As for me, I do not agree with this opinion. First of all, sometimes businessmen have important jobs and they must go to the other side of the Earth urgently. So they do not have time to go by other transport as plane is the fastest one. Moreover, some families are not able to go somewhere during long time, as they have little babies, old parents or they have illnesses, which not let them go for long by trains or other transport. So, air travel is the only way to have a rest for them. On the other side, people live till the environment is alive, so if nobody thinks about air pollution. In the near future we all will suffer from dangerous illnesses. So, businessmen can use other kinds of transport it will take additional 1-2 days, but the environment will be protected. Taking into consideration both viewpoints, I can say that there are many other global disasters, so air pollution caused by air travel is not as strong as, for instance, pollution caused by cars. All in all, nowadays people cannot refuse from air travel as economics of the world is based on business; so air business travels are too important and government should not take measures to reduce them.
