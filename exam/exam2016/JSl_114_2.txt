It is not a secret that there is a huge unemployment problem in the modern world. In some countries it became very difficult to find a job, while in others employees experience lack of workers. That is why, in our time, many big companies, which have their campuses all around the world, open more offices in poorer, developing countries as well as take local people to the work. In the following essay I am going to discuss both benefits and drawbacks of this movement. First of all, this is a very positive development because it can help the economics of poorer countries. It is known that the population of these countries is higher than in developed countries, so more people seek for a work. What is more, these countries do not have a lot of big companies with empty work places, so people has fewer opportunities to get a job, because of a high competition. When international companies move their businesses to developing countries, they give people a chance to get a good well-paided job, and furthermore an opportunity to increase their knowledge and have an experience to work in a big well-known company. On the other hand, moving to the poorer countries, companies loose a great amount of talented workers in other countries. So, people from developed countries have to follow the company movement and migrate to another country just to have a good job. To sum up the above, I would say that in my opinion, through it is a positive movement for people from poorer countries, it can demage the economics of other countries. In my personal point of view it probably would be better to help and teach developing countries to build new big international companies other than just give them free vacantions for the work.
