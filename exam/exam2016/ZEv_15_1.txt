The given diagram illustrates the difference of the amount of children who have no access to primary school education in 12 years period by gender and region. 
The overall picture shows that in every region the drop in the number of children appeared between 2000 and 2012. Also, it is noticeable that there are more girls than boys left without primary school education. The highest mark is hit by Africa in 2000 with roughly 45 millions of non-educated children. However, in 2012 this country imroves the statistics and shows a fall of approximatily 15 million children. On the other side, South Asia in 2012 presents the lowest level of kids with no access to primary school education. Although, we can see that the amount of children in South Asia in 2000 was roughly the same as in Africa in 2012. The rest of the world shows a different picture. Despite it having the lowest level among the regions in 2000, it presents not such a drastical change in 2012 as Africa or South Asia.
