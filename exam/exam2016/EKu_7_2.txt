Nowadays more and more people trying to make their business more productive and successful. International businesses are growing rapidly, so there is a growing perception about its sufficiency. There is an idea that international companies can make a movement of their bisuness to developing countries. On the one hand, it has some advantages. To begin with, companies can save money, if they employ local workers in poor countries, it will help to reduce unnesessary costs. Moreover, in this way international companies might produce essential goods for developing coutries, which will help to increase the level of life in developing countries that are suffering from poverty. In addition, when international companies move their businesses to pooper one, more work places are available for the society, so it will stimulate people to work and grow in social level. However, on the other hand, there are some disadvantages of this process. First of all, this movement might occur some problems for a company, for example, they can lost their management and high position in their own region. Secondly, not all developing countries have a suitable equipment, knowledge and skilfull staff to deal with modern technologies of developed world. Thirdly, such international business might be ineffective and not successful from the financial point of view. In conclusion, it can be stated that this process of movement has some benefits and drawbacks. Personally, I believe that disadvantages of this overweight the advantages. Hopefully, in the future developing countries will make a step forward in technological progress, which will allow them to hold the businesses of international companies.
