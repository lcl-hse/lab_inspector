It is in general argued such situation today when some companies open their businesses in developing countries, where they encourage local employees to work in abroad companies. This kind of development can be watched from two points of view, because it has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, there are good reasons why international companies should provide such changes. The chief reason for this improvement is that such policy helps to develop international businesses, global access and global communication. Furthermore, it is good opportunity for international companies to move their businesses to poorer countries, because local workers' salaries is much lower than in developed countries. Is standards of living are not high, the companies will get more profit, because people can work, getting a little wage. Moreover, not only international companies get profit, but also poorer countries have benefits, because its living conditionals also become better. On the other hand, there are some reasons against such development. First of all, if companies want to develop their businesses in poorer countries, they will lose the interest to do this in their native country. Thus, it means that the capital of their countries start decreasing. Such policy cannot be allowed by governments, so they can try to prevent it. Not with standing, development of businesses n poorer countries can sound great, it can have different difficulties for companies, because the governments do not want the money to go away from the country. In conclusion, it seems important to point out that, although, such advantages as cheap lobour force and more profit, international companies should not forget about some difficulties, which can be connected with problem between them and government, which do not simplified their businesses, but conversely, can damage it.
