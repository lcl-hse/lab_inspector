Nowadays, the most popular way of transportation is flying. Power structures should pay more attention to reducing the amount of air travelling, considering them as one of the reasons of air pollution and climate changes. To my mind, there should be made new laws, to control the number of air travel, because of abandon ozone layer eruption and throwing of pollutive gases in the atmosphere. First of all, it is a wide-known fact that by flights, using airplanes the ozone layer becomes thinker. By shortage of air travelling, people will decrease the influence on atmosphere, due ti the fact that airplanes will fly rarely or the amount of flying objects will become shorter. What is more, all transport systems use gasoline for dealing with their functions. Gasoline is unhealthy, pollutive substance for our planet and all living organisms. New laws will make chance to avoid negative affercomes. Taking into account, that many people die in the air accidents, it should be practical to make airplanes safer for people and for green world. Otherwise, till new ways of safe travelling haven't invented yet, the amount of flight, polluting atmosphere sould be shorted. Opposite, it's difficult to imagine society fully agree with such statement of the government, that's why all changes should be made slowly by using special methods, describing the ecological situation. To conclude, people have to pay more attention to the world in which they live. And such problems as air travelling, which cause pollution and global waming should be solved.
