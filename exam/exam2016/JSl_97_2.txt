A lot of international companies focus their business on poor countries and employ local workers. Some people think that this is a good idea to help developing countries, but others believe that this can only spoil the situation. In my opinion, developing countries need a lot of help of developed countries, so companies should support poor countries. First, helping to poor countries influence the world's quality of life in general. Standard of living reduces because of different illnesses in poor countries which don't have enough medicine to treat them, so international companies should develop some ways of transferring medicine to developing countries. This may help to reduce the world's death tendency. For example, brigning some medicine to Africa will decrease the children death. Furthermore, improving the situation in developing countries might help developed countries to use and find more natural resources in poor countries. For example, companies can build more school for children in Africa and because of better educational skills poor countries will help to use their resources to developed countries. To sum up, the improving of developing countries can move the world's situation of living only to the better side. May be in the nearest future there will be more companies that move their businesses to developing countries.
