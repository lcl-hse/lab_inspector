People widely believe that social media such as Facebook and Vkontakte should be used for sharing information and knowledge, yet another common idea is connected with entertainment. Who is right? In this essay we will have a look at both sides and I will give my own view. To start with, Facebook and Vkontakte have a wide audience, this is why sending information is really easy, as you may not only pass it to your friends or family, but also to other people. For example, news agencies have their own pages, where they place all the news uptime and people are getting to know about it as they receive notifications on their cellphones and computers. This is very impressive and useful, as you may find out that the rod, you drive for work is closed and get to know about other routs. Social networks are also great for knowledge exchange. Students or teachers (school, university) can send their studies or works just by a click of the mouse to others, that could be in many miles away. On the other hand, people argue that the main aim for such social media as Facebook and Vkontakte is to entertain. Yet, they have a point. Tis sources provide a wide range of games, fun pictures, programs for singing and a lot more. Entertainment is the way how these sites attract attention to them. Nevertheless, this is one of the main ways of earning money by such social networks. They provide additional abilities in the sphere of entertainment for the real money. To sum up, I would like to say that Facebook and Vkontakte are known all over the world, and the only reason for it is because they continue sharing information and entertainment. There are a lot of other websites that give an ability to exchange knowledge and even more that entertain its users. This is why it is difficult to imagine Facebook or Vkontakte without one of these aspect.
