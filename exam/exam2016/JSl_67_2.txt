Nowadays it is more valuable for international companies move their factories and other types of business making to developing countries and employ local workers because prime cost of their labour is lower than in developed countries. It is a control ersial issue but I personally do not agree with the statement that the advantages of such kind of situation can outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion moving business to developing countries may cause several problems in both of developed and developing ones. Firstly, from the last decade it can be seen that for example European countries not much work places for all workers that need them. A big amount of unemployment people which are more likely to do crimes creating other unpredictable problems may also cause distabilisstion in political area. It I always not good for both politicians, citizens and other types of people. Secondly, if many business move their businesses to poorer countries, developing of this countries may not continue as fast as it was in the past. Low cost of labour provides good conditions for foreign businessmen not for the native ones. Unequal will remain the same trend and developing countries may never become developed. If the country work not for itself but for the other country it just stops its developing. In conclusion I want to say that moving business and employing workers in developing countries have a big number of disadvantages and if we will think not only about nearest future we will understand that it is bad for people who live in both types of countries when companies make unequally between developing and developed countries at the situation like this. And moving businesses cause unequally in 90% of all amount of this kinds of situations.
