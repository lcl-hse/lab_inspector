Air travelling is very spread in our world today so their is too many flights everyday because planes provide gas and toxins while they on the fly. It has a big affect on global warming and fosters pollution. In the other hand, there is not only one point of view so that is my honour to present both of ideas and give my opinion then. Because of the big circulation of the air traffic there is big negative effects on our nature and our environment. It's not only gas providing but tons of oxygen burnt so the trees, the forests can't produce enough oxygen to solve this problem. If we will just deal with that fact would not we suffer in the future? Further more, there ice melting in the eydges of out world because of global warming and the level of waters in the oceans is slightly rising. It is obviously dangerous for coastlines and even a big cities can be in dangerous situation. Moreover, it touches all the humanity that there will be a bad concentration of toxins in the air so it may provide toxic rains especially in industrial cities. Many people think that there have been much unnecessary flights and the air travel for leisuring are unnecessary too. They suggest to introduce the laws to regulate those flights. So this position aims the long-time perspective of prevention of bad affects burnt fuel cause. In the other point of view, planes were invented to allow people travel fast and comfortable wherever they want. As we introduce those laws to stop air travelling we interrupt people's free to movement. People will suffer of this feeling and maybe cannot plan their holidays normally. There will be some injustice caused for groups of people. Also, business pand economic processs will not go at their normal way so there is bad effect on economical system. In conclusion, though it is hard to access but I think those laws should be introduced to stop this big affect on nature and humanity. It is more important to save our planet.
