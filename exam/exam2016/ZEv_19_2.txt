Nowadays it is believed that journeys and trips by aircrafts have become a catalyst and boosten like global warming and air pollution. Governments of many countries plan some certain laws associated with the reduction of journeys and trips by planes for work and activities because many of air travel do not need. 
To my mind, governments in the whole world should correct and regulate these moving because aircrafts produce the biggest amount of gas waste and CO2. According to the statistics, plains are defined as a transport, which has the hugest indexes of refusing waste per 1 metre in cube in the air. The total number of aircrufts in the world equal almost 10000 and they fly every day without a break for last 50 years polluting the air. 
More over, people really do not need to have so many travels by plane. According to the data of Aeroflot company, more than 50 percent of total flights have unnecessary purposes. If each man fly even once a week, during the year one flight will turn into thousands of flights, which will injure our environment and air in our case. 
However, if government reduct the number of air flight, this procedure will have a negative aspect on the private economy sector of all countries. Many air companies will have defaults because of the low number of flights. Also it will influence in governments' sector because air companies will not pay the certain taxes. 
To draw the conclusion, it is important to say that air travels are really one of the most actual problems in aspect associated with global warming and air pollution. Thus, the world should create some methods of struggling with this phenomennon except the method of air travels' reduction.
