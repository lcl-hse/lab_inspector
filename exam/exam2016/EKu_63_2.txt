Many international companies move their businesses to poorer countries and employ local worker there nowadays. Let's have a look at some advantages and disadvantages of this practice. On the one hand, moving buiseness to developing countries can help pople to survive. Poor countries have very bad circumstances for living, people who live there often lack food and water and die. Having filials of international companies in developing countries will provide people with work and probably supply them with some food and clothes. It is vital to offer such people help. Having buiseness in developing countries will also help people to have a better undersanding of how other cultures live and what they need. We live in the same world and need to know as much as possible about each other. On the other hand, the level of unemployalty is very high in the world. Even people in doveloped countries lack work. They have to do some dirty buiseness like selling drugs or becoming sex workers to survive. It is very dangerous for their lives. People can't get education because they lack money and the level of illiteracy grows. But anyway it is much easier to find help in bigger and more developed countries. They often have special social services to offer people help. Such social services can't be found in poor countries. In my opinion, the advantages of moving buisiness to poorer countries definately outweigh the disadvantages. We need to help developing countries to make the world a better place.
