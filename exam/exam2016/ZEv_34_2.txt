In modern world this is very popular to travel in airplanes. Of course, it can contribute to air polutions, global warming and other problems. Overall, there are different types of thinking about this topic. 
In my opinion not all air travels is necessary and it's right solution than government's do reduce a lot of them by introducing laws. Behind of this global problems such as air pollution or warming, this type of travelling do contribute to death of many and many peoples in this world. That is why it is not only problem of nature or governments, it is problem of all world. 
On the other hand, due to air travels we can change our location in every moment, when we want. Of course, it's amazing and very nice. Air travels do our lifes more comfortable. It is one of the main thought's of modern people: "how do my life more easier?". 
We can discussed about this question very long time, but I think, that when we talk about stability in nature, health of people and deaslity of world we should understand that there is nothing that can be more important. 
And in the end of this interesting essay I want write, that government's don't be able introduce laws that to reduce all air travels and other things to contribute air pollution and global warming, because it is important part of our lifes, but it be nice if it can to reduce unnecessary travels for business and leisure, individual demands.
