A huge number of air travel is unnecessary, but they destroy our cology and support air pollution and global warming. It is reasons for question: should goverment reduce the number of air travel for air company and use lows for it? 
I disagree with opinion to reduce the air chants by goverment. The first reason is ii can provide many ways for monopolistic in air market and many people can lose the most fast way to travelling. For example, I was born in Kurgan, but I am studying in Moscow. Way between Kurgan and Moscow is 2150 kilometres. It is more than 40 hours to trip on the train. However, I fly on airplane durig 2.5 hours every holidays, and I value it. Laws for reduce air travel delete this way for me. I will be bad for customers. The second reason is it can decrease science activity in air sciences. However, problem with pollution and global warming is very dangerous for all people. 
I think goverment can introduce laws which stimylate air company invest to air reseaches for decreasing pollutions of air planes. It can solve problem with pollution and others ecological problem without reducing air travel. Air companies have large profit. It should invest in researching, ecological programs and searching ways to reduce pollution from air company. I think it is the best decision, which goverment can introduce.
