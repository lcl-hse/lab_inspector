Air pollution and global warming use the most important problems for the mankind nowadays. Air travel is known to be one of the reasons of them. That is why some people say that the member of air travel should be reduced by governments and that they should introduce some laws to protect the environment from them. 
On the one hand, air travel is the best possible way of transporting people for long distances. As we know, time is the most important resource, air travel is probably the best invention during the history that help people to save their time. Another advantage of air travel is that air transport is the most safety on. The chanse to get into car accident is much higher than that your plane will fall down. 
On the other hand, the protection of the earth seems to be more important than time, we are responsible for the planet and should remember that it is the place where our children will live. 
However, statistics say that cars and factories pollute air much more than airplanes. So governments should the number of cars and limit types of producement which are the most harmful for the nature. What is about global warming, recent studies say that it is a result of climatic changes which are essential for the earth. 
In conclusion I would like to say, that our planet should be protected, but we should remember about the effitiency of this protection and flight the most important reasons first.
