The chart gives us information about the average time spent doing sport in England in 2012 by age and gender. From the given information it is clear that men at the age of 16-24 did sport more than any other category. They spent about 282 minutes for exercises. Then the trend fell dramatically, because the older a man was the less time he spent doing sport. The men over 75 years old spent only 29 minutes for different sport exercises. It is obviously that men devoted their time for sport more than women two times. Women had the same trend as men. Girls from sixteen to twenty four spent about 114 minutes doing sport exercises. Then the amount of time spent doing sport was considerably decreased. However, it should be noticed that the trend's falling of time spent doing exercises of women was slightler than men had. Overall, the period between sixteen and twenty four was the most popular time for sport both for men and women generally. Men spent more time for exercises than women.
