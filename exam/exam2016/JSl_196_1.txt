The charts show on which devices was Facebook used in 2012-2013 and for which purposes men and women spent their life at this social network. The first picture provides the information about using Facebook on computers and phones. The number of desktop users had declined slightly from 150 million to about 135 million by a year, since March 2012 to March 2013. For mobile users, the tendency is different: the number had increased from 55 million to 85 million - on a half the difference. The other picture shows in men's and women's behavior - what they do in Facebook. The most popular activity for women is sharing photos and vidoes - more than a half of them do this, comparing to 39% of men. Both 39% of every sex use Facebook to receive updates. Also lots of women (45%) choose Facebook to watch funny posts, with only 35% of men. At the end, 35% of women are learning how to help another people by Facebook. Only a quarter of men do this. As can be seen from the above, amount of people using mobile Facebook app or site has increased by 2012, but still most people prefer Facebook on desktop. Men and women use Facebook for different purpose: but for every choice the percent of women is more or equal to the men's one.
