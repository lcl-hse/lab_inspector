Nowadays social networks become an essential part of our fast life. A huge amount of people, especially teenagers, users social media for an exchange of information and knowledge on a daily basis. However, some people argue that the main aim of these networks is entertainment. This essay will look on both sides of an argument. Let us begin by outlining the main arguments of the opinion, that social media is for sharing information. First of all, with the help of social media you can gain knowledge from any part of our planet. For instance, everyone can communicate with foreighers, learning different languages with native-speakers. What is more, social networks save us the bother of spending time on calling. Today access to the Internet is cheaper than phone calls and it's faster to book hotel from Facebook rather than calling the reception. In addition to this, using Facebook or Vkontakte give us an opportunity to check news with one click as it is highlighting by editors in special public groups. Turning to the other side of an argument, social networks are considered as entertainment feature and nothing else. Firstly, social media give users an access to a huge database of music and videos, which is considered by many people as the most important advantage for them to use it. Secondly, social networks take a lot of time, and encourage people to spend time in sufficiently. That's why some people prefer not to use them on a regular basis, but simply for entertaining yourself. All things considered, I think that social media has changed people's lives a better way, but they should also spend their time on other activities.
