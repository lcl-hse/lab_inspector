Since the invention of the first plane, its role in human life has been growing sometimes rapidly, in other time slowly, but there almost were not periods, when its role decrease. But on the other side it harms to our planet by creating extra gases. So some people believe that government control is necessary option to save home planet. As a result this them becomes a "hot" topic to discuss in any society. On the one hand, businessmen and economists tells that this prohibition would damage to whole world's economic that would lead to unemployment or even crisis. Other argue that it would not have any dramatic results, because of substitution by other tools of travelling like ships, trains and cars. In the same time "Greens" do not pay any attitude to the economic problems, the only thing they think about is environment and car grandson's future. On the one hand it is quite silly position, but on the other hand. What could be better than saving world far future generations? Whole planet would be a statue for present generation. Moreover, limiting air pollution will effect on the future natural food, it would be lacked it pestisides and some other toxic elements. But returning to the main title, it is necessary to point that we live in a century of consumption, so it would be extremely hard to say no to the comfortable air travelling and substitute it by something more ecological. So an my mind, the most expected answer to the Earth is no.
