Nowdays there is a clear tendency in behaviour of many internetional companies which shows that internetional companies are moving their businesses to developing countries and employ local workers. Obviously, it reduces their consumers and makes a product cheaper so that the componies gain more profit selling this product later. Now we try to compate the advantages and disadvantages of this tendency. First of all, new departments which are being opened in poorer countries give locals lots of new work places so that they gain the opportunity to change their life for better. it also improves the local economics situation because the more people work in the country the more taxes they pay. So the foreign companies could be useful for the government because they increase the amount of money inside the country and help some particular areas to develop. For instance they can provide new technologies to the developing countries. Nevertheless, there are also can be a list a disadvantagies that this situation causes. People in poorer country often work for very poor selaries as they ready to work more and harder than people in developed countries. It is clear that it depends on the particular country in which international company establish its bussiness. Bills in this country should protect the locals but unfortuantelly they often do not. To my mind, advantages in the whole outweigh the disadvantages because people in the poor developing countries need job and they do not think about the unfair situation in the world and bad conditions. I think, countries should think about this situation in the world and try to change it to the better.
