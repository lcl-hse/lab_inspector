There is a common trend in international companies to remove their businesses from developed countries to poor developing countries, as it is a good source of workers. I personally incline more to the opinion that there is more advantages than disadvantages. There are several reasons for that. First of all, developing countries have a big amount of people, who are ready to work for a very small sallery. There is a lot of reasons why. Obviously, local workers really often have got big families, which are suffering from the lack of the meal, medicine, money. At this point, local workers ready to spend all day long doing the job that international companies will offer. Secondly, people who were born in developed countries since their childhood were trained to do hard work, so they don't have to rest often. They won't regret that they entered this job. According to the reserch from the University of Manchester, in India every second man is ready to work on international companies. However, there is also disadvantages such as the qualification of workers. Very often they don't have every school education. So it is rather strange to ask them to do the work they won't complete. But it is all nothing, because the work force is really enormous. To sum up, advantages of this development, obviously, outweight the disadvantages. It is easier for international companies to find workers in developing countries, because they need money to help their families. Secondly, they are very strong and ready yo work on the companies terms.
