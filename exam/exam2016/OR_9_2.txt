It is clear, that air travel has a polluted and global worming effect. Some people think, that it is possible to impose spesific laws to reduce the amount of business of leisure flies. 
I don't agree with this position, because there is a lot of different ways to protect our planet from environment disastors. Moreover, in case os cutting business travel, governments may destroy some economic collaborations between business in different country all over the world. 
As I previosly said, the problem of over-polluted athmosphier and global warming can be soleeved without pressure on airlines companies. First of all, it is necessary to regulate in higher rate gaint factory, which polluted not only the athmosphier but also waste the near territory, such as forests or rivers and all ecosystem around. 
Further more if there is a strong necessity to make a trip people will use other kinds of transport: cars, trains. And transcontinental travaling impossible to reduce. It means, that on the place of air transport will come anothe one, such as sea transport, which is also dangerous for see animals. 
There is no way to solve the problem of air pollution and global warming only by cutting the amount of business air trips and leisere traveling. The only chance to governments is complex strategy, which includes all potential sphiers, which may damege current environment situation. And I'm absolutely sure that only strong measures in each field; may lead us to result, which consists in unpolluted nature and health nation.
