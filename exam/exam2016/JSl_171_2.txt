There is a noticeable tendency today that the big amount of companies that spread their businesses worldwide decide to change the location for not-yet-developed countries and hire local citizens. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. First of all, it is an obvious statement that companies are chasing the revenue increasing, that is why they are seeking for new customers that are leaving in free from big consumption countries. Moreover, it is cheaper to produce goods in developing countries, as takes there are considerable lower. On the other hand, this tendency might cost a lot of such companies due to the lower workers' education and worse specialization. Moreover, developing countries' citizens are often less motivated to work properly because they are ready to earn any amount of cash. The last but not the least is to mention the location. It would be harder to maintain your business properly as it is thousand of kilometers away fro your main industrial point and chief's location. All in all, I personally, think that the advantages absolutely overweigh the disadvantages because these international companies have to find a new place for their development. Although they cannot get away from risks, it certainly worth expansioning. Both two sides will benefit from such a decision: developing countries will get new work places that are initial for them, while international companies will spread their goods or service to a brand new market. Filled will lots and lots of hungry customers.
