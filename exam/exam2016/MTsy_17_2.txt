We live in the fast-paced world aand transport infrastructure grows with the unprecedented rate including traveling by planes. Some people consider that air travel influences environment negatively therefore it is essential o reduce its amount. This is really controversial question but I somewhat disagree with this statement because of some certain reasons. 
To begin with, it is a common kwowledge that traveling by plans is one of the most sage transport. 
According to statistics, car accidents occure more frequently than in the air. To continue with, it is ridiculous to ban business trips by planes because problems must be solved fastly and plane is the most quick machine in comparison with others therefore busy people really appresiate this kind of transport. Also, a lot of relaxing destinations are situated far from business centres and it is more convenient to achive them by planes. 
On the other hand, air travel can be damage for nature because planes exhaust poison gases which pollute the atmosphere and cause the global warming. The situation is escalated in degree and intensity all over the world and reducing the amount of air travel is one of the measured which could be done. Furthermore, it is the most expensive kind of going trips and it is not easy to control air traffic therefore accidentsv and disasters happens ans no one has a chance to save themselves. 
All in all, I partly disagree with the opinions that it is necessary to reduce amount of air travel for business and leisure because it is not efficient to decline using of this transport because of its numerous advantages, for instance, comfort, less time-spending and safety. But you are free to disagree with me.
