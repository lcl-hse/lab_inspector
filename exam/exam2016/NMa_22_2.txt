The problem of air pollution and global warming is really actual in nowadays. This problem depends on many factors and the given cause in a only low part, but important part of this. The world constantly find solution of this problem and the path, that, in additior, reduces the air pollution due to reducing the count of air travel for business sector. 
I absolutely agree, that this path could become the solution of such global problem, as global warming. And, to be honest, I have no view, that cannot accept this, but I find a few argues, that confirmed this aim. 
Firstly, if it is true, that a lot of air travel is unnecessary, and it is used by personal aims, then I think it is just humanity egoism and we need to limit that for the future. 
Secondly, anything laws for governments it is the money which can be used for sorting air pollution issue. I think it is a good reason for limit the amount of air travel for business and give a second chance to our nature, to our world. 
Although, I guess, that reducing the count of airplane is a good price for the clearly sky and safety future. 
To sum up, I want to say, that people can donate the count of air travel for solving such great problem. And I have no idea why it isn't doing in our country, and in the biggest part of the world.
