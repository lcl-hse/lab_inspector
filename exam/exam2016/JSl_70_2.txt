In the modern world people live in poor and rich countries, so international companies should become bigger and they choose poor countries for opening new filials and take new workers. Almost they do this way because companies have a lot of opportunities and facilities in countries where they have not got any different companies and where there are a huge amount of free workers. So there are some advantages of moving business in developing countries. First is that there are a lot of people, who have not a job and who really want to know something more than basic knowledge. So companies could teach them how to work right. The second advantage is a free area. It includes natural resources and lonely business. Of course, big companies could use natural resources which could cost not so much as in a native country. So it is really pleasant for businessmen. And one more advantage is people, who have not got some things. For example, the company produces carpets and move business to Africa. In some areas people have no idea about carpets, so they will interested in producing and buying carpets. Moreover there are some disadvantages of moving business in poor countries. First of ll, some companies would have troubles with government of this country. It could be happen if there is a company which produce alcodrinks. So problem could be happen in Islamic countries (because of region). The second disadvantage is a big paper work which include documents for moving in poor country. It means that the process of moving could spend not a month, but one or more years. To conclude, there are more advantages than disadvantages of moving international companies' businesses to developing countries and employing local workers. But, personally, companies should be alternative to people and traditions of the country before moving businesses.
