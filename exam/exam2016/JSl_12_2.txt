Now, government want introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travels. I agree with it, because some air travels can provide to air pollution this ways of train should be laws, than now. 
The first reason do it, is risk of global warming. This transport can damage our ecological situation and pollute our air. It's lead on global warming, because it's link with azone disbalanse on air. Now this problem is very actual. If we can stop the one reason damage out ecological area, we will can stop and other happens with some problem. Air pollution give us future risk a global warming and other ecological catastrofy. The second reason, this transport not always nessesary. There are too much people, who can chose other ways for their business traines. Some times with ways more quicly and comfortable, when traines on road way, for example, people don't want waste their time and chose air travel on short travel. This reason is not so good, because our business are not necessary, but after it can destroy our environment area. There are a lot of other ways to train. People can used a car for exaple. It's not so big transport that's why it's more safety. For this reason, in conclusion, if goverments introduce laws to reduce the amount of air ways, it's will be helpful for us and all the Earth. Unnecessary things, such as small business travels on airline, should go in the past. Laws distanse is not a reason for air travels. We need to chose the most safety thing for usaly use. It's realy carefull and necessary.
