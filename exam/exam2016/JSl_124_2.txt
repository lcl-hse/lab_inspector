In the modern society a lot of companies which are international open their businesses in developing countries where get job local workers, it has both pros and cons. To begin with, the moving of such companies in poor regions give opportunity local people to develop yourself and get more money than they can iron in other companies. Moreover, such process can solve the problems which is conected with money. Nowadays, a great deal of people do not work and have not opportunity to buy necessary goods for their family and children. So, international companies ca provide a lot of work place in such areas for poor people. But there is no coin without the other side. First, in developing countries there are a lot of people who have not necessary education for working in companies of world level. So it can lead to unseccesful work of these companies. Also, such businesses, as a rule, require workers with knowledge in a special area. And last but not least, to open business in other countries a company should spend a lot of money and as a result in can be unrational decision. To put it in a nutshell, I would like to stress that arguments for the later idea cary more weight. However, I believe that companies which have opportunity to open their business in poor countries should help local people and give chance for them to get a job.
