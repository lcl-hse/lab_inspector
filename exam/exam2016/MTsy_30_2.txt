Nowadays people's life is quite complicated that is why there are many questions on which they cannot reach an agreement. Some people believe that a big use of airplanes lead to a great air pollution that is why flights should be limited by government while there are whose who are against it. 
In my opinion, it is good idea to find a balance that suits the most. On the one hand, travelling by air is the most convenient, fact and comfortable way to reach destination you want. It prevents you from traffic jams, long waitings and negative emotions. Moreover, some part of our world can be reached fastly only by plane. I mean that a travel to South America or Australia takes ages if we decided to go to it by ship. Also ot should be said that people in modern world are so busy and always in a hurry, that is why reduce the amount of air travel significantly can cause different problems. But, on the other hand, we must care about our planet and thinl about future on human beings so some rules, to my mind, should be introduced. For example, it can be useful to shorten the number of flights on a territory of one country. (the destination between Moscow and Saint Petersburg, for instance, can be easily overcame by "Lastochka" train for 5 hours). One more way, in my opinion, is to limit the amount of flights in a particular company according to its size. 
To sum up, to care about our planet or not is a personal choice of every person but I think that the amount of air travel cannot be reduce significantly but it is worth doing it on some way if we want to live on our planet for a long time and give a bright future to further generation.
