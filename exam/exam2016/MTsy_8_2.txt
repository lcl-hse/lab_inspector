Nowadays there are a lot of air travels. People use planes to traves for business trips, holidays trips and leisure activity. But sometimes air travel is unnecessary because people have no need to go somewhere by plane so there is a point of view, that the governments of different countries should decline the number of air travel by laws, because air transport causes air pollution and it is also a reason of global warming. But is the decrease of air transport a good idea or not? Let's consider. 
Let's start with the point of view, that the governments should ignore this situation and the amount of flights remains steady. There are a lot of advantages. 
Firstly, people can travel by plane as often as they want. Secondly, the price for tickets stays the same. 
As for disadvantages, the global warming and air pollution because of the air transport hurmes our planet. 
Now let's consider the opinion, that the governments should reduce the amount of flights. This situation has its advantages: air transport will pollute the atmosphere less, and there will be less air accidents. 
But this situation has a lot of disadvantages. Firstly, the price for tickets to planes will rise quickly. Only rich people will fly. 
Secondly, the majority of population will use other kinds of pub transport, for example, trains, cars, ships. So, we can't say, that these types of transport hurms our environment less, than planes. 
Thirdly, the tourism will stop to develop, because of lack of planes. Te fact, that the majority of people prefer to travel abroad for many thousands km. 
In addition si the same problems will take place in business. 
To sum it up, it is no need for governments to decline the amount of air travel, because firstly, air transport is the safest transport; secondly, without air transport our world stops develop.
