The bar chart illustrates the data of the amount of children that don't have possibility to study at primary school in the period from 2000 to 2012 grouped by region and gender. 
The main feature of graph is that the number of kids who can't even stdy at primary school decreased in all regions during observed period. 
However, both of Africa and South Asia had more children without access to primary education than the rest of the World in 2000. This situation got better in South Asia and this number fell down and it became lower than in the rest of World. 
The other feature is that in 2000 the amount of girls that have such a problem with access to education was higher that the boys. By the way, in 2012 this gender inequality went out in South Asia and in the rest of World, and on the other hand it still exists in Africa. The amount of boys without access to primary education is 14.5 million and girls is 18.2 million.
