There exists an opinion that the most important role of social media such as Facebook and Vkontakte should be to distribute information and knowledge. Some believe that the main idea of social media is simply to entertain. In my opinion, social media were created to entertain and connect people over the world. First of all, nowadays many people use their accounts in social media in order to listen music and play games. For example, there is the game "happy fermer" in Vkontakte that attracts many users. It influences people's behavior in a positive way and it is very important because now many people suffer under stress and they need something where they can relax. Moreover, social network are used in order to have possibility to watch online concerts all over the world. Some people organize online concerts that are very popular among audience. For example, the music group "the circle" organized online concert for those who cannot see them alive. It makes people happier. On the other hand social media are considered to share information and knowledge. Firstly, it is very important for students to share some information and knowledge. For example, in our university we use Facebook to share hometasks or discussing some subjects. Furthermore, some people use social media to communication with to people from other countries to discover something interesting about their home. In conclusion, I would like to say that I partly agree with the idea at social media being entertainment but I also believe that social media have the goal to share information and knowledge but in my opinion the purpose of entertainment is more important than sharing information.
