Nowadays most people choose air travel as the most comfortable and safe way of transportation. However, some people claims that excessive air travel lead to air pollution and global warming. People who support this fact demand to decline the quantity of air travel for business and leisure by accepting special laws. 
It is not a secret that most people ignore possible consequences of travelling by air. But in some decades it will be impossible to escape the catastrophe. People who understand it try to persuade governments to introduce special laws which will restrict excessive flying. Such laws can potentially help the world to slow down air pollution. 
Others argue, that accepting such restrictions can harm the world economy by reducing income of avia company and decreasing the quantity of business negotiations, i.e. entreprenears can refuse from possible acquisitions because of possibility of wasting time. Instead of reducing the amount of air travel, people who against any restrictions offer to invest more money in inventing biologically clean and safe engines which will not have any influence on our atmosphere. In this way, environment will get more income, because such technology can be applying to all factories, cars, trains, etc. moreover, biologically clean engines will consume less oil. That will safe money to both clients and companies itself. 
From my point of view, accepting any laws against flying is not the best solution to the problem. By doing this we will slow down the development of our civilization. Price for tickets will go up. Economical growth will slow down. As for me, it would be better to invest more money in technology. It is possible that inventing safe way of transportation will take some time but potential advantages of this method will cover all spendings.
