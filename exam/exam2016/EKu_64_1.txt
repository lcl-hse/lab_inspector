From 2006 to 2013 the dinamic of worldwide investment in renewable energy has been changing. The graph shows how much have developed and developing countries invested throughout these eight years and also the world total investments. In 2006, the emount of money spent on renewable energy has been the smallest - the world total investment was 100 Bn dollars shared by developed countries at 75% and developing countries at only 25%. This summ started to increase and in 2007 146 Bn dollars, more than 100 of which was invested by developed countries. in 2008 World total investment, risen up to 171 $ Bn around third of which was contributed by developing countries, decreased losing 3 billion dollars in 2009 eventhough developing countries invested several billions more. Still, in 2010 both developed and developing countries increased their investments and kept up with this dinamic in 2011, the year, when world total (279 $ Bn) and developed countries(179 $ Bn) investments reached their peaks. However, the climax year for developing countries investments was 2012 when they contributed more than a hundred billion dollars onto renewable energy compared to 140 $ Bn invested by developed countries. The decrease of world total investment continued in 2013 falling down to 214 $ Bn, shared between 125 $ Bn paid by Developed countries and the rest - by developing.
