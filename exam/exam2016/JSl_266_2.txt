Modern social-media networks like Facebook, Twitter, Vkontakte, Youtube, Reddit, Instagram and so on are so highly integrated in our day- today life that their absence at one day may literally become the end of the world we know. But what makes them different to any of us is a purpose of use. Whether social media should be to share information and knowledge or they are simply one more method of entertainment? New digital era give humanity many opportunities to overcome physical boards. The Internet is an never-ending library and social media neyworks are the greatest tools to share and discuss brand-new fascinating ideas or go deeper in old science. Some people say that the main purpose is entertainment and it also can be true. Old things like a television, papers, books and even theaters found new life at the Web by becoming Netflix, e-boks and etc. and social-media networks again are very useful as you can follow pages and blogs about your favorite sci-fi: unverce or just read jokes. To my mind, using social-media networks to simply entertain yourself is a waste of time of course, sometimes people need to give their brains relax, but when you stop learning and enhancing your knowledge and skills everyday what is the main purpose to live? Wise choice of blogs you follow on Facebook and clever sharing with your friends will improve yourself as a human and make a whole web-society better
