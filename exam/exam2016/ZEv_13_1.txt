The chart illustrates how the number of children with no access to primary education has changed in twelve years in different regions and by gender. 
It is seen that the highest number of such children is in Africa (around 43,7 millions in 2000), however it is shown that in 2012 the number decreased to 32,7 millions. Also the dame situation is about South Asia and the rest of World - the number fell a lot. 
The chart shows that in 2000 in all the regions girls have less access rather boys, however the situation has changed a lot: in South Asia and in the rest of World in 2012 the percentage of boys and girls became almost equial. 
To sum it up, there are some tendencies. Fortunately, the access to primary education increased from 2000 to 2012 in all the regions and also there is a tendency that nowadays in most of the world girls have the same opportunities for education as boys, except Africa where boys still have more chances to go to primary school.
