Some people believe that crime could be reduced by giving longer prison sentences. Others suppose that we should find alternative ways of reducing crime. Who is right? On the one hand, people might be feared by long prison sentences, so they do not want to break the law. Also, longer sentences ought to make more chances to reabilitate of prisoner because of they have more time to work with psicologists and to think about their life. Nowadays not everyone have this possibilities. On the other hand, preason could make people a social. So people of ther prison just cannot emagine their life without prison. This do not reduce crime at all. Probably, we should make jail programs more effective so prisonrers do not lost contact to society and do not maste their life. Moreover, we should not reduce crime after law breaking o government ought to develop programs that reduce the reasons for crime. Nowadays this system is successfully working in many countries. For example, in England people who affected by drugs could take a free dose and consultation to defeat illegal drug dealing. To sum up, we can see that not even length of prison sentences influence on their effectiveness. What is more ,we can reduce crime without prisons at all.
