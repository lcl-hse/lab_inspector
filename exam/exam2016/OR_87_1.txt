The chart represents an amount of boys and girls who do not have access to primary education in a time period from 2000 to 2012 in Africa, South Asia and the rest of world. In Africa the number of children without access to education separated by gender is almost equal - 20 millions of boys and 23.7 millions of girls and this number became smaller in 2012, but not much - it is still bigger than in other regions - 33 millions in general (in 2000 it was 44 millions). In South Asia the amount of non-educated in primary school children was 33 millions and then it falls dramatically to 10 millions in 2012 - and this number is smallest comparing to other regions. In the rest of the world common number of children without access to primary schools in 2000 is about 24 millions and then this number goes down to 15.5 millions in 2012. The amount of boys and girls in this region is almost equal in both time periods.
