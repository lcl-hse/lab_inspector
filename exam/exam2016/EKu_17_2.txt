There is a popular opinion that longer prison sentences are most effective for reducing crime, but the opposite belief that there are better ways is also strong. The longer sentences might be useful because they can give more time for inmates to be reeducated, put on a better path. That goal can only be achieved if the prison system is reasonably run and is capable for efficient reintroduction of prisoners into society. If the system is very flawed the longer stay in prison can do even more harm than good. The second and more convincing reason is that elongating prison sentences keeps criminals from the streets for longer. However, there are alternative ways to reduce crime. The main way to go is improving the punishment system. If the system is improved a lot of prisoners who would have returned to their ways even after a long stay in prison can be reeducated and succesfully join the society. Thus such measures as reasonably improving conditions in prisons, paying attention to reeducation, creating better environment for inmates evaluate their life can be very useful for reducing crime. In my opinion, the way of improving the punishment system is much more reasonable than introducing longer prison sentences. While longer sentences can be a good temporary measure it cannot be beneficial in the long run. Developing a better system of reeducation is bound to be a better way to go. That way te reduction of crime rates can become a trend. Nevertheless, it can depend on any particular case.
