Nowadays people care a lot about pollution and other global processes. It has become common place that people prefer air travelling for business and other aims. This way of travelling put under threat the wellbeing of the Earth, some people believe that this feature should force governments to establish laws that will decrease the time spent on travelling by planes. This point of view seems rather pointless for some reasons. To start with, it is undoubtful that planes' fumes contaminate air and cause global warming, but what can be said about the most widespread means of transport about the car? As cars are udes much more often, they pollute air even more, but it is not reasonable to restrict all means of transport just not to pollute the planet. People should invent new ways of transportation or improve existing ones so they would become more eco-friendly. Moreover, as more is the countries are democratic governments, laws that reduces amount of time spent traveling by planes for business and leisure whenever a person wants may be regarded as a restriction of freedom which is against the constitution. The last but not the least, there is something to be said for air travelling, it is one of the safest and the most comfortable means of transport. In addition, it is the quickest way of transportation. The pluses of using plains outweight their drawbacks. To conclude, it is evident that planes pollute air and cause global warming, but establishing laws to decline the amount of air travel is not a way of solving this problem, because people are eligible to choose means of transport that is most appropriate for their needs. The only thing that government should do is to force the improvement of planes so that they will produce less harmful fumes.
