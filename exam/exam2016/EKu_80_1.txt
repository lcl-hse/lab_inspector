The charts given demonstrate changes in the use of Facebook during a year (2012-2013) on different devices (computer and mobile phone) and the most important reasons why men and women use this social network. It can be deduced from the first chart that the number of people using mobile versions of Facebook nearly doubled during the period under discussion reaching approximately 100 millions of users in March 2013. By contrast, the number of people which prefered the desktop version decreased, yet, not dramatically: from approximately 150 millions of users to around 135 millions. Speaking about the reasons for using Facebook, it can be stated that sharing photos and videos was the most significant reason for both men and women; however, this answer was more popular among women and was chosen by 54 % of them. Similarly, women proved to be more interested in seeing funny posts than men (43 % and 35 % respectively) and significantly more interested in learning about ways to help others (35 % and 25 % respectively). Yet, 39 % of both men and women used Facebook for receiving updates. Overall, after analysing the charts, it could be stated that the mobile version of Facebook became much more popular than the desktop version, and women use this social network for more various reasons, than men.
