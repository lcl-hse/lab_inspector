The present graph depicts the share of profits of then four biggest companies: Apple, Samsung, Blackberry, HTC from 2010 to 2015 years. It can be clearly seen that while Apple rate increases twice in 5 years, the other companies show particularly the same shares of profits in 2015 in comparison with 2010. Firstly, it should be mentioned that the starting points of the three companies (except Apple) are quite similar and equal to 10-20 percent while the Apple rate is over 40 percent in 2010. Blackberry and HTC rates are slightly decreasing in the next five years and finish in the same point, which is about 5 percent. On the other hand, from 2010 to 2013 Apple and Samsung rates are sharply increasing with the same pace. However, after 2013 share profits of Apple continue to growth with the same tendency while share of profits of Samsung are decreased rapidly to the previous rate, which was reached in 2010.
