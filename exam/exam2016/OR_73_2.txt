It goes without saying, travelling by airplanes influense our ecosystem. But should government make extreme measures to solve this problem? There is an opinion, that government have to create special laws to regulate the level of travelling by air, to prove this argument people say, that air travel is unnecessary in most cases. I totally disagree with this idea. Firstly, is travelling by plane really unnecessary? I guess no! Air travel is the most convienient, and the fastest way to go somewhere. Secondly, there are great number of laws, and creating new ones will take much time and money. But still, I agree, that government have to make some measures to help our atmosphere stop suffering from air pollution and global warming. In my opinion there have to be some special protection basics on the Earth. I've read in one scientific article, that in twenty years there would be a chanse to use eco gas for airplanes. As I'm quite far from scienc, I can't defenetly say is that possible or not, but in my opinion, this idea is a suitable one. So, to my mind it would be unfaithful to prohibit or reduce the number of travelling by air. To sum up, I would like to say that inspite travelling by planes, or some other airmachines as well as all modern technologies destroy our planet's ecosystem by spoiling atmosphere, air pollution or global warming, governments must not use extreme measures to cope with this situation. There have to be some special tools in airmachines or on the surface of our planet to protect the world we live in.
