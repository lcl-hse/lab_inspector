Nowadays, there is a trend among big international companies to relocate their interprises to the countries of the so called Third World. This means that the chiefs of such companies build factories and plants in developing countries and hire local people to work there. Let me consider both advantages and disadvantages of the process and decide, whethere it is appropriate of not to move the business. There are several advatanges of building industrial sites in poor countries. First of all, new interprise provide work places for locals and give them chance to become more civilized. For example, when an international company moves a business to a developing country, it needs workers and for that reason provides free education for local people. Another advantage is that local children gain an opportunity to get higher education in the developed country from which the business was moved. In other words, sooner or later the new factories will need qualified local workers to be managed by, so the chiefs often build new schools in the area or provide free higher education for local youngsters. It can be added that not only schools can appear in the country of "daughter company", but also other infrastructure facilities like roads, hospitals etc. however, there are disadvantages too. Firstly, it is environmental pollution. International companies generally move the business because they do not want to harm the environment of developed countries. As a result, the pure nature of poor countries suffers from pollution. Another disadvantage is that local work force is usually cheap. People in poor countries do not require high salaries so they do hard work fro small amount of money. Summing up, we can see that there are more advantages of the process of moving business to developing countries, but I am in favour of the idea that the harm caused by disadvantages is so serious that event the improvements cannot cover it.
