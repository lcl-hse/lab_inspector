This graph shows the amount of money both developed and developing countries invested in renewable energe and changes in investment during the period from 2006 to 2013. We can clearly see that in 2006 it started growing, and developed countries envested more then twice as much as developing. Together they spent about 100 $ Bn. In 2008 it stopped going up and remained in the same level until 2009. What could be interesting is that developing countries started investing more and in 2009 developing countries invested 68 $ Bn compered to 100 $ Bn invested by developed countries. From 2009 to 2011 the amount of money invested in renewable energy had been rapidly increasing and it picked in 2011 with investment of 279 $ Bn and developed countries spent twice as much as developing which also could be a tendency in this graph. In 2011 it started going into decline. During the period from 2011 to 2013 the amount of money decreased and in 2013 it was 214 $ Bn which is still more than it was in 2006.
