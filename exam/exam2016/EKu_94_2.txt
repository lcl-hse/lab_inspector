Nowadays, the amount of various crime has a social interest and there are a lot of different ways to decrease these. In my paper, I put forward the claim that various ways can be mixed, consenquently, there will be better ways for the reduction of crimes. To my mind, the giving longer prison sentences is conservative way for the reducing. On the one hand, it can make fears for people who would like to do something criminal and a future punishment can stop their activity. On the other hand, this way seems cruelly because sometimes there are people who did not kill or did not make an argon, for instance, but policy do not pay attention on circumstances that play a significant role. On the basis of evidence, it seems fair to suggest idea that is about other measures for the reducing. For instance, a building of different organisation that will help people who have problems, with money for reduction of the robbery. One more clear example is creation of organisations that will tell about consiquents in the case when anyone do something against laws. As a rebbutal to this paper, it might be convisingly argued that It is extremely important to make conditions to reduce crime but they must be done when the crime is not occured. To sum up, the goverment of every country and other social groups and organisations have to control the level of the crime and minimalize its using various ways and measures that were represented in my essay.
