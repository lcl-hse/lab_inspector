The given chart presents how many boys and girls have not got an opportunity to go to primary school in different parts of the world. 
If we look on data about Africa we will understand that children in this country are the least educated (if we compare with the rest of the World). But we can see a positive tendension: to 2012 the number of children who can get an access to primary education rise on 11 million. Let's turn our attention to South Asia. It should be pointed out that there is a significant improve in a sphere of education in this area. According to the graph, number of girls who can go to primary schools rise on about 17 millions from 2000 to 2012. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that an education become more and more important from year to year. And not only developed countries try to modernized and extend an access to primary education (the chart illustrate that the amount of young people in the rest of the world arise in avarage on 8 millions) but a developing countries try to support this upward trend.
