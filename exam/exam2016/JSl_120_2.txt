In recent years there is a trend to organize businesses in developing countries by big international companies. Furthermore, these companies give workplaces to many employees in such conntries. However, what are the advantages and disadvantages of this process? On the one hand, some people think, that such kind of activity helps the society to reduce the poverty in developing countries. Furthermore, it can lead to better income and, of course, better life in these areas. However, there is another big advantage of such activity - it is cheap work force. It comes as no surprise that is non-developed countries the employees are less qualified than in developed countries. So, it is a good idea of save some money for international companies. On the other hand, some expertise claim, that there is no infrastructure in these countries. Hence, multinational companies can force with a lot of problems developing business there. From my point of view both position save relevant and it is only the company, that should choose the appropriate way for making business where they want. So, to sum it up, it is vital to note that a lot of multinational companies tend to increase the influence on a global market and it is really good idea to rise business in developing countries instead of developed countries. However, every international company should think about some difficulties of such kind of activity on these areas, because it can have a great impact on these country and the whole society worldwide.
