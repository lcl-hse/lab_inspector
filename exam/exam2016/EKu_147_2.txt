As for me, there are stronger advantages of the fact that a lot of international firms start their business in developing contries and hire domestic workers, than disadvantages. One of the advantages of this tendensy is a great opportunity for local workers to get a carrier qrowth and to become more experienced in the field of their occupation. It is widely believed that people in poorer countries tend to work harder and to study while they work, because they are more ambitious. Moreover, this tendency will help developing countries to raise their heads and to start achieving their main goal - becoming a self-confident developed countries. Furthermore, it is possible that such moving can help these companies to expand in the future. One of the disadvantages of this fact is decreasing interest to international companies in developed countries, outwhere they came from. It can happen that because of developing business in poor countries, the situation in large developed countries might become worse, if they do not lead their affairs carefully. Another disadvantage is the situation when business in developing countries go bankrupt, but there is always such risk. To sum it all up, such current tendency as moving large firms to smaller and poorer developing countries has obviously pros and cons; however, to my mind, such advantages as, for instance, increasing employment possibilities, opportunities to learn by work and developing a country in the whole are stronger.
