Nowadays, crime is one of the most important problem in our word. Lots of people suffer from killers, terrorists and other criminal people. Some people believe that longer prison sentences will reduce crime rate. Meanwhile, other people concern the other ways of reducing crime. In my opinion, there are many alternative ways that help to reduce crime atmosphere in the society. For instance, prisoners instead of being in prison for long period, can do the social work or another routine work that need more people. In addition, killers, robbers and so on should be punished strongly, but not for much time. Otherwise, they will use to be in prison, and after prison will continue doing the crimes to return in prison. Nevertheless, some people think that nothing but prison can change the person. So they think as longer someone is punished as better it will be for him or she. On the one hand, I see what they mean, there is no doubt, that prison has influence on people. But on the other hand I cannot go along with this, because there is not enough that government can do with criminal people. To say more, people, who do the crime, should have the talk with physiologist or another special people, who response for people thoughts and actions. To sum up, I go for the alternative ways of reducing crime and believe that something else except the long prison sentences can change the person, who has done something wrong in his life.
