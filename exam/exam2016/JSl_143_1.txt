The graph illustrates how the investment in renewable energy changed from 2006 to 2013 in developing and developed countries and in the world in total. As far as we can see, developed countries were investing more than developing ones for the whole period. An interesting feature is that both developed and developing countries' investments were slowly growing and reached the peak of approximately 180 and 100$ bn in 2011. Then, unfortunately, the investments started to reduce. The graph demonstrating the investment in Renewable energy in the whole world in total shows as the same tendency. The highest investments were made in 2011 and were equaled 279$ bn. One distinguishing feature which differs developing countries from developed is that their investments were continuing to increase after 2011. However, after reaching the peak in 20 12, they were dropped as well. It is first decrease in investment for the developing countries since 2006. Unfortunately, world's investments were also getting less significant since 2011 and were about 65$ bn smaller than it were that year.
