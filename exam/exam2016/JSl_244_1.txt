The diagram shows the degree of changes during the period of 2000-2012 in the number of children who lack primary education by region and gender. The most important and interesting feature are presented below. The global trend for the number of children without access to primary education is undoubtedly downward, with a decrease by 11 million children in Africa, a decrease by 21 million children in South Asia, and, correspondingly, a decrease by 7 million children in the rest of the world. It is noticeable, however, that Africa still remains the region with the highest number of children primary education. By 2012, the figures had become the same as for South Asia in 2000, whereas the number of those who lack primary education in South Asia fell dramatically, from 33 million to 10 million children. It is worth nothing that, in general, girls has less access to primary education in 2000. The situation seems to have improved in South Asia and the rest of the world, whereas in Africa there were more girls than boys without primary education in 2012 ( 18,2 million and 14,5 million, correspondingly).
