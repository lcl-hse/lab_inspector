Nowadays there are more than ten thousands avia companies in the world. In this second there are more than 300 planes in the Moscow's atmosphere. This avia companies make world smaller, whih give a lot of opportunities to people. And in my opinion you cannot deny this benefit. If the government introduce new laws, which say that you can use avia transport only for business, the government will face with some problems. 
Firstly, this las are nor good for people, who like travel. Because they bring their opportunity to travel to all countries in the world. 
Second problem is decrease of number people's air travels. And income from avia companies go down too, which not good for economic of country. Because most income for air company give people who travel by plane. 
But I cannot deny that air travel have some consequences. The most important threat is global warming. A lot of polutions go to our atmosphere from planes' oil, because its TSI very dangerous for our world. 
In conclusion, I want to say that we can do nothing, because progrecc go up and people must wait when planes will "eat green oil". Although I disagree to make new laws in air travel.
