The chart represents the different numbers of children who were reduced the opportunity to go to primary school because of their gender or region during the period of 12 years - from 2000 to 2012. It's seen that the amount of children without access to primary school education is higher in Africa and South Asia that in rest countries of the world. Moreover, it's obvious that the number of these children is lower in all countries in 2012 than in 2000. The highest number of children without access to pripary education was in 2000 in Africa and it reached the mark for about 45 millions: 23.7 millions of girls and only 20 millions of boys. In 2012 this number became lower - 33 millions of children, but still the amount of girls was bigger. There was a dramatic fall in number of children between 2000 and 2012 in South Asia: approximately 33 millions for 2000 and only 10 millions in 2012. It's also worth mentioning that in 2000 the number of girls was more than twice higher than the number of boys. Speaking about the rest of the world we can see a slightly fall during the period of 12 years: from almost 25 millions of children in 2000 to more than 15 millions in 2012. The numbers of boys and girls in these years were quite equal.
