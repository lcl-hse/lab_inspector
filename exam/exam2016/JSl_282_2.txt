Nowadays there are several points of view about social networks' purpose. A lot of people strongly believe the social media should provide information and knowledge to its users, while others claim that social networks should just entertain people. In this essay I would like to cover both these points of view and express my own. Somebody says that social media should wide the users' horizons and share new knowledge with them. Social media might be quite efficient as the resource of information, moreover, a lot of people use social networks in order to learn something new or to find out necessary fact. For instance, all my groupmates subscribe for social public pages on Facebook that post some interesting facts or news. At the sometime there are people who prefer to use social media only for entertaining purposes. These persons prefer to spend time chatting with friends, watching funny videos, reading posts of famous people and so on. For example, both facebook and Vkontakte provide a lot of interesting and funny stories on its' websites in or to entertain people. There is a huge among to entertaining content on these websites. I agree with both points of view and my opinion is that people should use social media both for educational and entertaining purpose because networks like Facebook let us use it for both these purpose at the same time. I strongly believe that in the future people who use social media only for one purpose will use social websites for entertaining and self-education.
