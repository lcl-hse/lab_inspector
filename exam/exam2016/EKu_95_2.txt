Nowadays more and more people are worried about crime situation in their countries. Everyone wants to feel safe, so people are searching for the ways to reduce crimes. Whether it is good to have longer prison sentences or people need to find other possible solutions to this problem is a controversial issue worths discussing. Some people believe that giving more serious punishment for criminals will reduce crime. To begin with, if criminals stay in prison for a longer period, they will have enough time to think about their crimes and may be they will not come back to their previous life. In addition, people who want to do an act that is illegal will be afraid of the longer prison sentences and that fact can stop them from it. Moreover, when the most dangerous criminals are in prison for a longer time, their friends who helped them to commite crime will not do it without their leader. On the other hand, there are a lot of people who are sure that giving longer prison senteces will not be the rigth solution for this problem. Firstly, when criminals are intend to commite crime they usually do not think about consequences that is why longer prison sentences will not help. Secondly, living in prison for a long time can have a bad influence on some people. Thirdly, criminal who live in prison for so long cannot come back to normal life, it will be difficult for them to find a good job, so, they will do another crimes. In conclusion, the issue of crime situation is a difficuts theme and everyone has his own solution to this problem. Personally, I think that we need to give longer senteces to reduce crimes. Hopefully, in the future humaniti will find the best way to reduce crime and live in safe world.
