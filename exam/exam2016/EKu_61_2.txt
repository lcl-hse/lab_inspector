Most people accept that nowadays a lot of companies move their business to developing countries according to many different reasons. But their can face some difficulties with disadvantages of such approach. Many people believe that emphasing on the own country is the best way for developing it. But others consider moving to poorer countries as the bes way for doing business. The first reason why advantages outweigh the disavantages is the prices. That is not a secret that labour in developing countries is cheeper than in developed ones. So it seems rather thoughtful to reduce the amount of money people invest in business. A second reason is recources. It is very clever to try to avoid such problem facing the mankind as overpopullation. Going to another country where many natural resourses and not so many people may simplify the process of producing something. A last reason but not the least is that there is a possibility to improve the technic development, to show the locals new science inventions or to invent something important on the area, where it's necessary. Employing local workers helps to solve the problem of unemployment in developing countries, so we can conclude it's a big advantage too. As far as all businesses are different, such approach to increase an income may not be appropriate for everyone. So businessmen,who is going to move their business in developing countries should think over all variants suitable for the business, because disadvantages always may outweigh the advantages
