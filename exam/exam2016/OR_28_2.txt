Nowadays travelling by plane negatively impact on the envronment. There is a controversial point that governments should decrease the number of plane using for some less important actions because of huge amount of travelling by air transport as a whole. As for me, we should protect environment from different damage included air pollution and global warming. In this essay will be discussed neccessarity of protection air health compared with importance of using air travelling. 
The first idea is about alternative types of travelling. Many businessmen an rich people fond of using personal planes for moving in the air. It will be better for nature if they join to public air travelling or start use eco-friendly transport. As a result, air pollution level will decrease because of decreasing amount of travelling by plane. Some people believe that this way of moving inconvenient but they are wrong. There are special zones with a high level of comfort in planes. 
The second idea is about using internet conversation instead of some real meetings. There are a lot of comfortable programmes for chatting through the internet such as Skype and Viber. According to this idea amount of using air transport also will be decreased, what can support to protect environment. Some people think that real contact with a partner better, but due to modern technologies you can have eye-to-eye contact during the talking through the internet. 
In conclusion, I would like to underline that air pollution and global warming are serious problems for humanity. People should use air transport as less as they can and try to be in touch with modern eco-friendly technologies.
