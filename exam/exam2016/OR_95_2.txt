It is acknowledged, that environment suffers from carbon emissions of different types of machines. Such of them is plane. In connection with there is point of view that governments should prohibit frequent air flights for business and leisure. So, is it possible and reasonable? On the one hand, governments could unite their opportunities and organize mutual special schedule of flights. They could divide it into following categories: "rare" and "frequent" flights, because in most cases planes are almost empty. Secondary, government could encourage people by travelling, another types of machines, create special conditions, which are practically similar to the benefits of air travel (time, convenience). On the other hand, thanks to achievements of technological progress government can force private companies to shift on BIO fuel, which are safer and less harmful. On the contrary, to confine flights mean to ignore economical factors: much countries survive thanks to tourism and it can lead to its default. Nevertheless, both positions have upsides and downsides, however the most rational measure is to reduce frequent flights and improve, perfect, implementate the achievements of technological progress; switch to BIO fuel, built fast, ground transport and take care of estate of environment for further generations.
