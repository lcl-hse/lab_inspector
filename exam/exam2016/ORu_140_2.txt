Today majority of parents work long hours. Thus, they do not have enough time for their children. In my essay I will consider reasons for this and consequencies of that. The first reason I would like to mention is that modern life is more expensive now than is used to be in the past. So adults have to work long shilfts to be able to provide their children with good education, high-quality food and etc. Another reason for that is that many parents put their success in career over family values. It is more vital for them to achieve social realization than to devote some time to their children. They are too absorbed in their work for that. In comparison, in the past family values for more important in the society, that's why majority of children didn't lack parents' attention. This behaviour of modern parents cause various problems. First and foremost, children does not feel that their parents love them and care about them, so it can make them feel lonely. Sometimes they have no one to talk over their problems, they don't feel like they confide their family, so they may get in bad companies. Furthermore, all parents have to look after their children, as children are unwise but some of them do not show interest in children's life. Thus, children might get in troubles, like having bad friends or they might develop drug addiction. If this happens and their parents don't learn about that, in time, it can lead to terrible problems like death of a child. In conclusion I would like to say that parents shouldn't forget about their children and devote at least several hours per day to them.
