The development of companies all over the world is rapidly increasing today as well as their number. International companies have plenty of fillials in various countries and cities, that no doubts, has some consequences. I firmly believe, that moving business to another country may have more positive affection, than negative, especially when this places are in poverty. The causes of such changes influence not only the company itself, but also the country, that was chosen to become a new place of the business. The value of having an opportunity to become an employee of an international business company is rather high, because people can obtain new knowledges and skill, which they haven't got a chance to get before. Also, poor countries as a rule represent a problem of employment and many people can't find a job. By the employment of local workers international companies may help people not to face this problem and more. Furthermore, such possibilities that country and it's nationality obtain can help to get out from poverty and to uplift it's status. However, there are also some disadvantages than can have a negative impact on the country. The main one is, that companies of the country where business was settled may face misses of workers, that can be retired on their desire because they may want to work in a new company. It can cause significant conflicts between them, that can influence the country dramatically. At the same time this new company cannot have interest in this country because of its specific characteristics. For example company that sell ice is unnecessary in Arctica. However, I still think, that advantages of moving the business of th international company to poorer countries outweigh all the disadvantages, because, to my mind, poor countries need help of will-developed ones to reduce its poverty and such cases can have a positive affection on the whole development of the country.
