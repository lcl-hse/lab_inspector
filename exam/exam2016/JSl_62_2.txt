There is a new tendency in running business in modern life: lots of international companies get used to have their business in poorer and developing countries than in developed one. Moreover, there they prefer to employ local workers. Of course. This situation eigher has advantages or disadvantages. In the essay both sides will be discussed. On the on hand, initially land and employee in developing countries are cheaper. By the same taken there are lots of people who are siking work and who are ready to work for small salary. For example, we are aware of many eases when people from poorer countries move to another one so as to make living as for himself so for his or her family. Hence, that is why to hire stuff will be neither as piece of a cake, but not too hard. On the other hand, is a person already has his or her own business, it will be to difficult to remove all thing that concernes it to another place. In addition, it more likely will cost an arm or leg. And when it have happened, running business will become more difficult for company, because of various reasons. The first is language differences (if it is no the same language speaking country), the second is another culture, and et cetera. Summarising the information, it should be said that every activity has as pluses so minoses and this one is not an exception. As regards running business in another country, each company has to weight everything and for them it is important to realise what benefits they can get if thy move their business to another place.
