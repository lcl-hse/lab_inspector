It is no doubt that nowadays in the World there are lots of environmental problems like air pollution, noise pollution, water and so on. And to solute this serious problem is not easy. There is opinion, that the one of the cause of air pollution is airplane, and for the solving it government should decrease the number of air travel. Unfortunately, I do not agree with these opinion, and below I will try to explain my idea. 
First of all, it is quite understandable that the air travel is not only one cause of pollution and global warming. For example, care, manufactures and people's factors as whole can be cause of these problem too. That is why government should not only airplanes to decline number of travel, but and for others polluted factors. 
Secondly, if government will control the amount of business air travel and tourism, than people can be agrassive. For illustrating I have businessman, because of reducing the number of business travel, they can to lose money ad clients. It is unprofitable for people. Moreover may be problem with educational program. 
In conclusion, I should say that government should pay its attention on rather sphere for regulation problem like air pollution, not only one, government should provide some educational program about that. Global warming is not only because of airplane, it is mostly due to us - people.
