This picture illustrates trend of renewable energy investment in the period between 2006 and 2013. One bar chart shows changes which happened in developed countries, another one is for developing governments. And the third line, which is above summaries the world trend. As can be seen, there is a steadily growth of the amount of the investment during the whole period for developing countries. The pattern reached the peak in 2012 and later increased a little. Points for the developed countries are significantly higher than for developing ones, but the general trend has the same shape. The highest point here happened in 2011. After this year, there is a considerable drop, which continued to the end of the period. The world total pattern, as we can see, proves the patterns which we saw in two previous bar charts. There is a peak in 2011, as in developed countries, the growth of the investment till that year and decreasing after reaching the peak. All the graph have the same steps, which prove each other and give useful information to make the right prediction for future years.
