Nowadays tavelling by a plane is very wide-spread and convenient way of transporting. However, it is considered as the most polluting type of transport which can affect environment seriously, even it may increase the global warming. 
On the one hand, air travel is fast and this is the major advantage of this type of transport. It is a great opportunity to reach another end of a country or the world for the shortest time, especially if if necesarry. For example, if some disaster happens and there are a lot of people who are need help. 
On the other hand, air travelling is not the safest, because every week news are told us about some catastrophe. It is also not the cheapest way of travelling and not every person can afford it. Moreover, planes have negative effect on the environment, producing a lot of gases which waste not only air, but also ground and water. These gases increase the temperatures all around the world, and this causes the global warming, which can create so much natural disasters. 
I believe that air travelling is worth remaining in our life despite all disadvantages, but only for very important things. I think governments have to reduce or introduce taxes for privat flights, different business flights and travelling by plane for leisure. It would help to cut pollution, to make people able to choose aproppriate type of travelling and to be responsible for their choices, helping the nature and themselves.
