In our days it is impossible to work hard for 1 parent and usually both parents spend their time at work, but their childrens take less attention to then in past. It is really apple of decord today and in my essay I want to write about reasons of it. First of all, in our changeable world all people want to be success, that is why a lot of adults spend their life at work. By the way, they work during the day around 8-16 hours and can't give time to their children. Parents want to give their child good education but it need the money, which they earn at hard work. Secondly, we live in the modern world and it is worldwide profession "babysitter". In pat it was grandma or grandpa, but now parent think that babysitter more useful for their children. For example, they can educate baby any language or help with other subjects, such as math, physics, biology, etc. Moreover, babysitters have more quality than parents in relationship with teenagers. But on the other hand it can be a big problem for parents, because if they won't pay attention on child, he/she can turn into bad company, such as people, which drink alcohol, or smoke cigarettes, or more redicolous - drugs. Nevertheless, if we know children from rich families more dangerous, because their parents don't spend time with them and child grew with bad influence in internet. With money they do what they want and don't care about nothing. To sum it all up, I want to say that nowadays parents really spend less time with their children, but they want to give children good childhood, education, and future, that is why we have this problem in our days.
