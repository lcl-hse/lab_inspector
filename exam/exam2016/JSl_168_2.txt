Today many international companies tend to move their business to developing countries and employ local workers. It is really ambigious notion that it have more advantages than disadvanatges. On the one hand, it may be really useful for companies and customers. First of all, if the company desides to move they business to poorer country, company's product will cost less, compared with the situation when the company locates in the any European country or American for example. However, in the real situation, it is clear that quality of production is worse. For example, one company named "MAC" moved her business in China and as a result now they have same problem with the customers. First of all, it depend on people who do this production. Local workers can't control quality of cosmetics which have a world name. as a result many people, who used this cosmetics, have a problem with they skin. If the company wants to move her business in some poor countries, it will be understandable that the quality of production will be worse compared with the situation when company has business in any European countries. For example, all of us tend to understand that if production of the company is done in America, it is a good production with a great quality control. To sum up, of course, today every company may move her business in some poorer countries, but it is understandable that the quality of the goods may be worse, because if the company spend less money on production the quality will be worse.
