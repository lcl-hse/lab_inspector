Today social websites such as Vkontakte and Facebook are popular all over the world and it is clear that they are used in different ways. Some people believe that these sites are set up to share some facts and information, while the others suppose that their main aim is to provide entertainment. In my essay I will look at both points regarding various arguments. So, on the one hand, social media can be a great source of knowledge. Firstly, using such websites is widely spread in the majority of countries that makes it possible to reduce illiteracy among population. For instance, every second person in Russia, according to statistics, uses Vkontakte. That is why it why it may be a great source of views of absolutely different persons - a wonderful opportunity for people to broader their winds. Secondly, these social websites provided with special functions (such as "to share" and so on) make it easier to spread information: you have an opportunity to share some facts with both your friends or just people who yo do not know. On the other hand, for some people social media means only entertainment. The reason is that it is widely believed that social websites are not reliable sources of information, which contain many biased opinions as everybody can share their point of view. Furthermore, using social media many people cannot focus on essential or useful information because they are easily distracted by their friends writing them too often. That is why, sharing knowledge by social media tends to be useless. To sum up, I would like to say that social websites may be used on various ways it depends on a personality of a user, however, I believe that social media such as Facebook is created sharing knowledge as I suppose that entertainment online is not a good idea, people should do it in other way (such as meeting with each other). So, social media - a good way to share information).
