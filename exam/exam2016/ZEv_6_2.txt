Nowadays such global problems as warming and air pollution are discussed all over the world. It is important, that one of the main reason of this occasion is air travelling. That is why, governments are thinking about introduction of some laws in order to cut down the number of unnecessary flyings. For my point of view, this solution is more right. This essay will show arguments and evidence of it. 
First of all, reducing of business and leisure travellings will not trouble passengers. If the person have to be in the exact place, he will take another ticket. Moreover, it is a benefit for aircompanies too. It is known, that lots of planes are not full completely. That is why we can see the economic reason. 
Speaking about nature, we can point that every measure in order to save planet is very important. Reducing the number of flyings will make our air more fresh, clear and prevent from the disaster of global warming. 
Some people are sure, that it will not help. They consider, that it is better to increase flights but find and invest much money to the ecological departments of countries. 
I do not agree with this meaning because there are some problems, which are easier to avoid with the help of reducing reasons of this problem. In our situation the reason is the big amount of planes flying all over the world every day. 
In conclusion, I would like to repeat that our main mission is to save our planet, do not damage it by ourselves. In this way we have to do all impossible what we can.
