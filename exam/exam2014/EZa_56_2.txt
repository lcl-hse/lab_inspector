Nowadays, we live in an age of information in which everyone can easily find anything they want to. This also includes the art and media sphere. With development of technologies and lifestyle culture modified too. Creative artists now are free to express themselves in different kind of art and government should not create any restrictions and obstacles to this process. In my opinion, that trend seems to be right and obvious. 
Firstly, artists creativity of all kinds is a part of great culture of their homeland. Every expressed idea makes its own donate to culture, so government should support that natural culture development, bot not make different kinds of restrictions. Secondly, products of creative artists such as pictures, music, films and others inspire ordinairy people in their fights with everyday problems. It is a great source of support and inspiration power, which helps everyone to refresh their spirits in hard times. 
Other people have different point of view. It is believed that modern art is aimed mostly on sexual and violence themes and it can be harmful for people who are easy to impress and the only way to defend them from that kind of art is the following government should provide special laws to restrict the freedom in free spreading of that kind of art. 
To sum up, the developement of art sphere with expressing ideas by creative should be held in natural atmosphere but it is necessary for government to shield children and sensitive people from sexual and violent content.
