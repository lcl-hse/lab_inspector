Nowadays people more and more focused on their health. The young and the older try to care about themselves. Actually some people are sure that if the government increases the quantity of places for doing sport, the aim stated will be reached, other think there are lots of other ways in deciding this problem. To begin with, people of the first group want more sport equipment. They say if the government will build special areas for sport and let people use it for free there will be more humans involved in sport process. The point of view is worth existing, because it can be seen in our city that if it is a new beautiful football field, for example, there are always some people playing the game mentioned. A lot of people want to do sport, but do not have facilities for playing games or just running. In contrast, other people claim that facilities are not so important. As far as they are concerned it is better to make people love sport. For example, beautiful and healthy girls and boys could be shown on TV. When a person sees perfect bodies, he or she wants to be similar to people, who have such bodies. Moreover, same leactures in school can be provided. These leactures should be devoted to utility of doing sport. If a child does sport from his or her childhood, he or she will probably do it all his or her life and learn to love sport young generation in future. What is more, there are possible decisions of people's health problems from other sides. For example, it is a good idea of spreading information about cigarettes and alcohol harm. To sum up, I think it is better to work with people's minds and make them understand pluses of doing sport instead of building new sport facilities, because the latter will influence people, but not so, efficiently as learning them to live healthy lives.
