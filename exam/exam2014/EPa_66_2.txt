Nowadays people society has got a lot of environmental problems and, of course, public health is decreasing every years. Governments establish different policies to increase health level. There are a lot of world organizations that try to reduce mostly dangerous diseases. People argue in what way we should increase our health. Someone claims for sport, others think that it is not the best way. 
In my opinion, sport facilities can help us to improve our health level. I believe that people who involved in sport live longer and healthier. Nowadays we have a lot sport disciplines and people can choose what they according to their opinions and evryone have chances to start because there a lot sport sections all over the world. But you are not allowed to be professional sportsman. As evryone know health of real sportsmen is not good enough when they retaire because of a lot of injures. 
What is more, I cannot refuse ideas that not only sport facilities can improve public health. I believe that governments should play main role in increasing people's health. That is why they should provide different policies and programms for people, also support finansialy local hospitals, schools and universties. As I can remember, our region government support all schools in region to provide medical analisis and tests for all puipls several times in year. Nowaday different countries try to help each other, because problem of low level of public health is the most important. 
In conclusion, I would like to sum up, that sport, of course, is very useful and it really increase health. But doing only sport facilities will not help in reducing this problem. Level of public health is not only national, it is world wide problem. First of all, people should understand this problem and decide for themselves what they want.
