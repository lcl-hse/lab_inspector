Hardly nobody would argue that happiness is a crucial part of our life. Every human is trying to be happy. It was yet Plato who considered that man is born to be happy. Still there are huge problems every man has to deal on that issue. In this essay two ones will be discussed: identifying happiness (what is it?) and factors which are important in reading this very essence of the sense of life. 
First of all, I will confirm that all the difficulties in identifying happiness exist due to a misunderstanding of the term. Nearly all of us think that happiness should be like something material or something that descends to you from somewhere else, while, in my mind, happiness is a regime of our own minds. If a human mind and a human body are systems they should work like our feds and machines. this way, happiness is a right regime for our mind and body which should not be strongly distinguished. In achieving this state of mind we should be mind-disciplined: be positive and open-minded. Setting up goals and achieving themis a very important factor to reach happiness. We should realise and materialise our creative individual nature and go on to a creative success. Look at the scientists: they are always in a process of creation new concepts on the base of new data and they are happy. 
To conclude, I should repeat that happiness is not a gift but a result of our self-discipline. This discipline should include creative practicts as eassential part of a human nature.
