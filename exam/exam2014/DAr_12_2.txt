It is widely believed that the total amount of sport centres and organisations determines the level of public health and the most efficient way to increase it is to develop the system of sport in a country. From the other point of view, those are hardly bound. Personally I think that there is an obvious link and support the idea of developing sport and this essay will explain why. To begin with, any sport facility the visitor's health, no matter what sport they do. Moreover, sport encourage people to change their lifestyle and habits: to accept a healthy diet, to walk more, to go in for active sports during holidays such as beach volleyball rather that lying on a beach and so on. It is hard to combine smoking and sports. Furthermore, going to a sports centre simply leaves no time for lying in front of a TV and procrastinating: it is always involves movement, action, makes one fit. The opposing side of the idea claim that increasing the number of sports facilities has little effect. Nobody may be interested in the idea and start training. Also, going in for sport does not necessarily mean that one stops smoking, drinking alcohol simultaneously, etc. However, they do not consider that good social advertising and other national programmes are not excluded! Moreover, as already mentioned, sport provokes to lead a better lifestyle. To sum up, I am convinced that improving the sports system means improving the national health. Due to the listed reasons this conclusion seems inevitable and obvious.
