Today we live in the modern society where the education plays a vital role in people's life, because it has a greate impact on their future job and, as a result, financial position and future life. But disproportion between male and female in different subjects at universities leads some problems with supply and demand on the labour market. So, some people belive that universities should accept the same amount of men and women students in every subjects. 
On the top of that I should say that this solution can decrease a women discrimination in some proffesions, for instance in a nuclear physics or in a some government positions. Moreover, equal numbers of male and female students can make a learning science more comfortable for female as well as for male. 
At the same time, this measure has a negative consequences. The first feature that I should add is that there are some fields where equal numbers of men and women is impossible. For example, police and army is mostly men's occupations, but fashion and cooking is actually women's deals. 
If observe this issue from practical and realistic view, we clearly understand that universities will decline this idea because of it's unproductivity and unefficiency. 
To cut a long story short, this is a very intricate problem. But it goes without saying that this trying to install a balance on a labour market can have a negative consequences.
