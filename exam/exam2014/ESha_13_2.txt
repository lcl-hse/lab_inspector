Creative artists must all the time be given the freedan to express their own feelings and ideas in way what they want. Is that right? Yes, sure. But only if their producing is non-commercial. If their arts, music, and pictures, don't bring the rotting in humans mind. 
Human can't do something with his heart and soul for money. It is true. But, what the songs we listen when they aren't for sale? 
For true artists is not the word "creativity" - it is wrond. The main part of artists live their life is only like a glass, like a mirror. The are reflecting all that happening in their head and around they. Artist are unrotiond - they don't need in optimite system. 
It is a big advantage when artistic people live without system. For example - if Adolph Hitler had no problem with their possibility to learn in classical paint-academy, the main part of humans had no problems. 
There no disadvantages when art don't bring destruction in our lives in our heads, hearts and souls. 
Our life system make me feel it. Everything I want is give up all what I have. Find a little hause in woods, eat rice without anything - my physical body needs an energy and of course, draw paintings all the time that I can live. I don't need. I have all in my head and arms. And other artists too. We need in freedom. Freedom for us and our brothers is all that we need in.
