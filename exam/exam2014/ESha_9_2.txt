Creative artists should always be free to express their own ideas. They can write books, paint pictures, make film or music. But very often artists don't think about how their products can affected on people. For example, an artist can write a very sad song or make a dramatic film that can make people feel bad or unhappy. As a result, people can fall in depression. Also an artist' product can expand any dangerous idea that can be harmful for society. 
For the reasons mentioned above, I believe that the artist' freedom must be limited by government. There is must be any cencer that will check the main ideas of artist' work and will decide should it be seen in society or should not. But also censor must not have any ideology, it have to only keep the psycological health of people. It does not mean that all works have to do not involve any emotions or intellegent idea. It means that this.
