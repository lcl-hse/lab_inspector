The charts below show us the main reasons for study among students of different ages and the interest, the employers pay on them. 
On the first chart we can see the statistics tells us about what the students of different age cathegories try to get their education for. So, if we take a brief look on the blocks, we can easily say, that situation changes mirrorable after the cathegory of 40-49. People, who have just graduated from the school prefer higher education in order to get a well-paid job. But, starting from 80% of age under 26 it gradually falls down to the near 20% at the age of 49. 
It's connected with the fact, that when you teach an age of 49, you are supposed to had a lot of work during your life, you made money, you already did all the necessaries, connected to your labour experience and you want to learn something new; that's the only reason why the youths prefer career and mature people choose their education programme in case they really interested in it. We can see it on the graphic, by scale "for interest" grows rapidly from 25% after 30 - 39 and finishing with 70% in cathegory over 49. 
On the second graph, we see the percentage of Employer support, judging by the age group. Under age of 26, when you're young and have a lot of needs the level of support is the highest - near 62%. Going to the age of 30 - 39 the helping level dicreases to 35%. And then, there is a rising in the level of support as you get older. So, people of the age of 49 have more chances to get help from employer.
