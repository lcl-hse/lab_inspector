The government restrictions on artists work is an issue, which frequently generates a great deal of heated debate, with supportes maintaining the fact is all artist's work should be freedom for all kind of ideas they want. However, other people claim that government should control and restrict the creative artist's work. In this essay the arguments supporting the this issue will be discussed. 
On the one hand, we are living in the faced-paced development, where values of living are constantly changing. Thus, new works of art in museums and all kind of films are changing too. As can been seen clearly, this modern not ones becomes less popular than it was in the past but also heavy to understand esspessialy foe youth generation. There are contain a lot of violence, which have a bad influence on children's views. 
There are a lot of examples when children want to be entertained and therefore, when they watch a modern film with a lot of violence on it, have a bad influence on theire behavior and views. Taking everything into consideration the best course of action would be to control all ideas of creative artists for decrease a bad influence for children and young generation. 
On the other hand, if government will restrict all of artist's work the artists can't work productively, because they will be under a big pressure. As a result, the number of really talented works will be less, then in the past. It is very bad for all modern art and films. 
In conclusion, according all arguments it should be said, there is no absolute answer to the question of government restriction on creative artist's work, but from my point of view, government should control the ideas of artist, because sometimes that works have a bad influence for children's and young generation's views.
