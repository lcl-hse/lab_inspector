It is well known that schools often expierence problems with student behaviour. And the question what are the causes of this is controversial. Phycologists as well as teachers make different suggestions about this problem and about ways to cope with it. 
In my point of view there is a vast majority of causes of this problems. First of all, schools often does not take into account student's life background, their personal problems in the process of education. Secondly, schools sometimes does not watch the atmosphere in the school. The atmosphere itself influence the relationship among students. 
Personally I think, there are a lot of approaches to this problems. Firstly, schools can hire more phycologists to deal with students' mental problems. Another solution to this problem is development of different social programmes, that could familiarize students with consequances of bad behaviour. 
In conclusion, it is very important to find solutions to problems with students' behaviour due to the fact that there is a strong link between students' behaviour and their inner world.
