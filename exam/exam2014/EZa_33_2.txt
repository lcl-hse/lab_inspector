Nowadays, as well as long time ago people try to realise what happiness is it and how we ca reach it. Everyone gives different answers for all of these questions. It is difficult to understand it and to make a strong clear list of factors, which are important in achieving happiness. 
First of all, for my opinion, mostly people try to find their love, to make a family and children. More than that, it is really important when all your family, parent and relatives, close friends and also yourself are healthy and always in a positive mood. In addiction, to provide a good happy life, for you and people, who you love, you should have a well paid job, that can give you a lot of opportunities. Furthermore, your job ought to be actually interesting and exciting for you. Only in that case you can be glad and satisfied with your profession. 
Secondly, there are a lot of things that can make you happy, but many people often don't understand it. For example, the art. When you listen to classical music or you admire different works of art in a gallery, you can feel real great happiness. Besides, it is inexpressive feeling of pleasure, when you are interested in some great books, or when you travel around the world and can see sights of different nations and cultures. 
To sum up, I would like to say that it is impossible to describe all aspects that can bring you happiness. This theme is timeless for discuss and everyone can choose his own way to achieve such a great feeling of happiness.
