Many people argue that the most what can be done for public health is to increase the number of sport facilities. However, others believe that it cannot change anything. I believe it can. 
First of al, people who do not believe in use of sport facilities say that young people today do not need it, for them it is better to stay at home, watching TV and playing computer games, and even if there are some sport grounds youngsters prefer to drink and smoke there. What is more, they say that it is far too expencive for government and there are some more important things that need investments. 
But as far as I am concerned, I cannot agree with this point of view. Firstly, when children have abilities to play sports since the childhood, they will always like sports and try to keep in a good shape, for example, playing and doing sports later with their families. Secondly, I believe that there is no more important things for government than to improve public health because it is made not only for our generation but for the sake of future generations. What is more, I cannot say that it is always expensive for government, for example, rodes for cyclyng and fields for playing football or volleyball are quite easy to be organized. 
To sum up, I would like to say that certainly, not everything depends on some sport facilities, government should introduce some laws to restrict smoking and consumption of a alcohol. Children and young people need to have sport activities not only at school or university, but to feel sport loyalty in their families. Each person needs to have opportunity to do sports and government should support it.
