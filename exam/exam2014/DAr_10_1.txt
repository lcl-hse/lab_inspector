The charts illustrate the changes between the ages of the population in two countries: Italy and Yemen, in two period of time: 2000 and 2050. We can see that children and teenagers (people from 0 to 14) in both country lose their position in proportion of population. And elderly people have a bigger proportion in 2050 than in 2000 in Italy and Yemen. The differences between the Italy and Yemen is that in Yemen the number of people from 15 to 59 years old is rised and in Italy is declined. Also, the biggest percentages of population in 2050 in Yemen will be 15-59 years old people. In fact, in Italy we can see the similar situation in the future, but the proportion will be different. To sum up, the charts show that the ages of the populations can be different in past, present and future time. In both country we can see the changes between 2000 and 2050 in the number of the populations (depends on ages).
