Nowadays there is a widespred belief that the most significant way of public health improvement is by increasing the amount of sports taking place in an everyday life, although some people may disagree with this point of view claiming that it will not make a great effect on the whole sihnation. To my mind, the latter argument has a stronger possible argumentation. 
To begin with, let's consider the situation when person has gone in for sports or is affected by the new health care policy at the present. No matter how good the person is informed about the benefits of a healthy life-style and about the drawbacks of the opposite one still the most important and the only relevant factor is the self-consciesnons of the person about whether it is good or bad to smoke, in particular, in public places. So, this is why the increasing of sports facilities' number itself can be observed only as the part of a very complicated policy. 
In my opinion, the main part of the issue's solving lies in the fact that all our beliefs and inner rules have been formed in the childhood. Consequently, there are two main prospests of how shildren's minds should be affected in the terms of health-care policy. Firstly it is about a strict control of mass-media censure, including radio, TV, and internet. Secondly, the way upbringing was going on anay determiners the rest of the person's life. So, it is the matter of parent's skills to rise the proper beliefs in their child's minds. 
In conclusion, the improvement of public health should implies a complicated solving policy, while the increasing of sports facilities is just the partial one.
