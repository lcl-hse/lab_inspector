There is an opinion that the best way to improve public health is increasing the number of sports facilities. But other people argue that this would have little effect on public health. 
Firstly, the increasing number of sports facilities improve public health. It is obvious, that different kinds of sports allow people to chose what they want according to their skills, preferences and a level of health. The good example that illustates if we can see in HSE. There are lots of free sport section and you can choose from swimming to football, basketball and so on. Students of the HSE go to sport, that is why we have good health. It is very important for us, because every day we have stressful situations that are harmful for our health. Sports help us to relax and allow not to think about staduing. 
Secondly, there is opinion that increasing the number of sport facilities would have little effect on public health. People of such thoughs believe that nowdays lots of sports facilities are useless and that they do not improve our health. For example today there are lots of new section of boxing. Such kinds of boxing are created only for earning money. Also it is important to say, that very often such sections destroy our health. Today parents tend to develop their children and unfortunately do not know some feachers of different sports before sending their children to sport sections. 
In conclusion I want to say that increasing number of sports facilities is good, because it expands our choices. But we should be very careful for choosing sport, because it depends on your health.
