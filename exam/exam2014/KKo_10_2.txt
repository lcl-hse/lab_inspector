There are two stated opinions about ways to improve people's health. The one part of people is about to think that the best measure will be increasing number of sports facilities while the others think that it will not be very effective and other ways of solving this problem should be found. 
In my opinion, increasing the number of sports facilities and making them free can be the best opportunity to increase the health level of people. It is not a secret that each kind of sport or even gym is really expensive now. Not every family can afford to pay for their sport activities or their childrens ones. Moreover, I have an argument for my point of view. In the Soviet Union there were a lot of entertainment and sports activities and they were free and there were more people desiring to do sports. Furthermore, there is well known statistics that shows us that our grandparents and parents who lived in USSR were much stronger and healthier. 
But on the other hand, other measures can be suitable too. For example, obligatory physical education classes should take place at universities and colleges as it is now at schools. And for sure, the level of medical care must be increased by the government's policy. 
To sum up, the option of increasing the number of sports facilities seems to me more efficient, but the other variants can have an effect too. 
To my mind, everything depends on ourselves and our desire, if we have an aim to rise our level of health and become stronger, we will definetely cope with it.
