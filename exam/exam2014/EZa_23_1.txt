A white segment of the pie chart is the biggest of all 4 segments and it shows that mainly electricity is used for heating. Other 3 segments are approximately equal and demonstrate the data of a more detailed look on the graph reveals that English people use electricity in afternoon more often than in morning hours. It is 20000 units of electricity in summer when people have no need to switch on the light and 40000 in winter. In addition the level of spending electricity increases in the evening hours in winter.
