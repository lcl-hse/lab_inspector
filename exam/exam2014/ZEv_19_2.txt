These days a lot of the countries have the same problem of worsening of students behaviour. Many people are triing to solve that, and to make proper decisions there is a need to work out the key factors causing the behaviour change. 
As far as I'm concerned, one of the main reasons of bad behaviour is a nurture. Everyone faces different problems and meets different people while getting older. These difficult situations and acquaintances influence a person greatly both in positive and negative ways depending on the situation. 
One of the important causes is also the character of a person. During the process of growing everyone tries to attract attention and become respected somehow. That is why some people behave badly thinking such a way will help him to look older or cleverer even though this is not always work. 
Personally, I also believe that some teachers might be the cause of the bad behaviour of students. Those teachers who have strong character, who are strict and loyal at the same time will never face negative attitude from their students. 
What can be done to solve the problem of worsening behaviour among students? First of all, I believe it is important to talk with students who behave in a bad way. Dialogue has always been among the best means of solving problems. More than that, while talking people will know each other better and more likely to understand each other. 
Ultimately, I suppose that bad behaviour will also survive in the society. As the school is very important stage of getting future experience it will always face such a problem. I believe that it have to be solved with every student privately, and primarily in a form of the dialogue.
