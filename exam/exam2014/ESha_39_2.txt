People claim that affordable and conviently situated sport facilities is a solution for most of the public health problems. Others state that this step is not enough and other measures should be taken. 
The main arguments for the first opinion are the following. Firstly, it is cheaper and easier not to threat the illness but to stop it from evolving. Better health means better immune system means less illness. Without a doubt person is more likely to use a sport centre if it is within a walking distance from his/her home. So more sport facilities lead to stronger health. Secondly, person who uses gym regularly tends to pay more attention to his eating habbits and day routine. If anything even running exercises are far less difficulte for non-smoker. This means that availability of sports centres can have a positive effect on people's avareness of their health. 
Nevertheless more must be done for public health. Often even when person cares about his/her health he/she has no opportunity to buy healthy food, because the information on the products is unreliable or even non-existing or this kinds of products are too expensive. This example illistrates that increasing the number of sport facilities should go alongside with other measures. Moreover, when person gets sick, the needed medical threatment must be provided, so he/she must be covered with insurance of some kind, sport centres will be useless in this case. 
To sum it up I want do say that while well-placed sports facilities have a wide range a benefits the public health problem cannot be solve only by them.
