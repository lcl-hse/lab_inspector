Nowadays there are many faculties where a different number of boys and girls study. Personally, I believe that a number of female and male students must be equal in the majority of universities. What is better for universities, to have equal numbers of people of the same gender, is a controversial issue worth discussing. 
It is often argued that the proportion of male students should be equal to the proportion of girls. Firstly, it would be perfect, if every boy can talk with another girl. The result would be the following: every student has a lot of attention and communication to his person. Secondly, a teacher can practice his or her sociable skills in order to get on well with the students of both genders. 
In addition, some parents think that a faculty with an equal number of girls and boys is a good opportunity for their daughters and sons to get married. If a male student manages to have excellent relationships with a female student in university, then in the future she will have a brilliant chance to become his wife. Moreover, at present the women are fewer than men. So it can cause the decrease of the population in the case if a number of girls are bigger. The demografic situation can be worse because of this fact. 
Nowadays it is a very important question which depends on the opinion of everyone. I consider that it is much better when all universities can have an equal number of the students of the both genders on every faculty because all students become more sociable due to communication with each other and because it can effect demografic situation in a positive way.
