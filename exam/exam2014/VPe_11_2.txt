Nowadays, there are a lot of opinions about young people's work. In some countries they are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Let's discuss all prons and cons of it. 
First of all, I want to say that a gap year it's a really good help for young people after school, because, usually, they don't know what university they want to choose or what they particularly want to do, besides, it's the best opportunity to get an experience, to meet new friends and to earn some money. 
On the other hand this year can interrupt people's education, because travelling and well-paid work very attractive for young people. It's generally agreed that now many people have a dream to earn a lot of money without efforts. We have some examples, when the young people reached a success without university education and even without high school education, but it's only a story, a fairytale. We should pay for all in our life. 
In my opinion, a gap year it's very good thing only if your parents have possibilities on it. So many young people cannot afford themselves, university education and they need to find the job. When I was finishing my school, I did not know what way I want to choose and I was very afraid . 
To draw the conclusion one can say that we should only think about our future. A rest or a work can disturb or can help, it depends on us.
