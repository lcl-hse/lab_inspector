They say creative people should be free to express their creativity in any way they want. 
In my personal opinion culture and art is certainly an inceporable peace of our everyday life. So those who create genuine art are vital for the soeciety to develope in the right direction. Though, creative artists are obviously should feel free to express themself in all ways of art like literature, cinema, painting etc., they still should have some moral boundaries, not necessary provided by government. I do believe that everyone should know the difference between expressing themselves and total limitless egoism. Especially when those artist want the audience to see or to hear their masterpience. What I mean is art cannot be associated with insulting others, making harm to others even if the Creator suppose it is how He sees the world. For example, a famous singer is writing a rude song about his enemy or a person he just dislikes. As soon as the people hear this song, they will have prejudices against this person without even knowing him/her. 
Moreover, sometimes so-called art can have some inappropriate content, it can be inappropriate for children, for instance. This is when the government can interfere and put some age restrictions. 
All in all, I understand that artist are free spirits, though I still stick to the idea that the genuine (which is very important) art and the rules of morality and tolerance should compromise in order to prevent chaos and misunderstanding.
