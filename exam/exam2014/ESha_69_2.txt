The topic about public health is a very debateable question. Some people think that the best way to improve public health is to increase the number of sports facilities. Other say that this would not have a significant effect on the public health and there are better ways to reach it. 
To begin with, which results can give the increasing the number of sport facilities. First of all, people prefer different type of sport. Some people like tennis, others like football. If we want to improve public health by increasing sport facilities, we would to build wide different facilities. Then all people can find for themselves the lovely type of sport. 
There are another ways to reach the improving of public health. To begin with government and social organisation should develop the medicine. The high level of medicine. Can provide the high level of public health. If people can get qualified help from medical workers and all medical centre will have a different types of new technology, then public healt will rise. 
As for me, in my opinion, every way of improving public health is good. But we should pay attention, that we can get the best results if we combine these ways. In this case, people will take a part in different types of sport to increase own health, but people, who feel disease frequently should be deal with sport under looking of medical workers. 
All things considered, there are many ways to improve public health. Society can reach the best results if it combines all these ways.
