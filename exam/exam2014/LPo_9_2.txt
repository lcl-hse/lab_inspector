Recently there has been considerable discussion if the universities should accept the equal number of male and female students. In my opinion, they should not. 
Nowadays there are many different professional fields in the society. Every of them has its own features ans peculiarities. Doctors, teachers, engineer, builders - all this specialties includes not only the professional knowledges and skills, but also gender characteristics. There are many stereotypes and examples of existance only man and woman professions. Almost all my friends-boy study and work in the technical and physical spheres, while girls prefer social professions such as sociologist, journalists and so on, from my point of view it's right and very widespread situation. So it is the first reason why it is not neccssary to accept the same quantity of male and female students in every subject. 
The second reason is that because of the descrimination of woman in the east countries, they do not have opportunity to work in some spheres. More than that in Russia and, maybe, in other modern countries, some employers are used to give work with computers, instruments, etc. to man. Due to this fact some woman woman with education in such field can stay unemployment. 
To sum up these arguments I consider that the discussion about the equal number of woman and man in every subject should stay only in theory. Moreover, to my mind, it is not so important to pay so much attention to sex of the students. I believe that more important significance for accepting the students to the universities is their level of knowledge and education that can be measure by test, interview and what not.
