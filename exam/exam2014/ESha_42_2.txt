Nowadays in the modern world all people pay attention on their health, all of them want to be strong and to have a healthy body. And as a result there are two groups of people. One group of them thinks that great number of sport facilities can improve their health. The others believe that there are others way to be healthy. 
First of all, people, which are interested in sport, say that different sport activities are quite useful for a men not only like a hobby or interest. It can help people to be healthy. And as a result they ask government to increase the number of sport facilities. There is an example, which make it clear. For instance some people try to develop sport in our country. They try to find some investors, which can invest money for building new sport centres where all families can spend their time. And the level of Russian people's health will increase sharply. 
Going to the next point of view, there are people, which prefer other ways of improving their health. For example some people believe that diet is the best thing for creating health body. They think that balance in eating food has a great effect on our life. And if you will eat only fresh fruits, vegetables, fish and other products which are rich of useful vitamins you can improve your health. 
Now it can be concluded that in my opinion sport is an important component to become healthy and if in our country the number of sport facilities will increase it can improve health of all people in our country.
