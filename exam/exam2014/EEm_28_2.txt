Talking about history of education, it's really hard to predict what programms will appear in the future. Nothing stay unchangeble, and educational process also changed. 
Is it good that only girls or boys vicited some subjects? Isnt't it unfair? As for me, I think it is interesting to work not only with boys or girls. It hepls to create a healthy atmosphere at class room, to work with different opinions and views. Also, it is difficult to organaise the educational process in the way that will be the equal number of mele and female students in every subject.
