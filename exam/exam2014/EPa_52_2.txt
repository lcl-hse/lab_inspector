Nowadays the Olimpic games stay very popular. And other sports events became more and more interesting for people. In that way, the problem of sports and health population stays one of the contral for evry develop country. 
There are two main point of view to diside this case. Some people think that if goverment increase the nomber of sport facilities the shere of sports an health people will be increase. Because if there is no oportynety to do sport, people wouldn't be do it. It connect with other problem of people today. They allways should think about many other problem: how to earn money, where the education is better, and other. If they do not see how often people thaining, now it is interesting and exiting, they will imideatly stop to think that the sports training importan for them. Onother exampel is expensive training. Nowdays the are many lucshury fitness centers, but it is very expensive to trainning in it, and people do not have enought oportunity to visit them. 
However there is anothe point of veiw on this problem. Other people belive that it is not depent how manysports oportunetly they have, if people do not want to make some excercise, they would not do it even training will be free and avalible. To be a sportmen or not complenty depend on mind of people. And first of all we should try to change mind. That people want to be a sportmen, after this they find oportunity by their self. And we should think obaut anothe oportunity to increse health of population; for exampel increse the nomber of hospital in the towns. 
But I think it is important to keep balance between this to side. Becouse one side cannot to be with another. If people do not want to do sport, they wouldn't, if people do not have oportunity to dy sport, they wouldn't. Ofcours sports one of the best way to improve health of population, and it people will have enought oportunity and want to do sport, the health of population will dromatically increase.
