There is an opinion that the best way to make people healthier is to invest in improving sport facilities. However, some people argue it is not as helpful as other measures. But which point of view is right? 
To my mind, increasing number of sports facilities will not change the situation in modern society, because nowadays very often people have to tire not only to do sports, but even to sleep enough or cook dinner. That is why new sports buildings will not lend the increasing number of their "club members". What is more, same health problems cannot be solved by new sports areas. For instance, cancer or blood diseases. However, the most widespread areas modern people are illness of cardio system and, of course, overweight. In this case doing some sport is the best way to improve public health. Moreover, new playgrounds are important in poor regions to decrease the level of crimes, because little potential burglars "will spend their free time playing football instead of meeting each other in dark places". 
But, surely, I do think that improving sports facilities is not enough to provide people's health. The most important is to explain them that their health depends on their own choice : to eat or not to eat junk food, to have a walk or to sit in front of the screen, watching TV, to do everything to be healthy or to do nothing. And if people understand that the problem of their health is inside of them, public health will, consiquently, be improved. 
In conclusion, the best way to change the situation in population's health is not only to invest in new sports buildings, but to explain people how important it is to keep fit and to stay healthy and how their behavior in present will influence on their health in future, This way, I guess, it the most sensible and the most helpful.
