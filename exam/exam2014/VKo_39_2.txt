Lattes political events and legislative initiatives have raised certain vital problem of government restrictions in the acts. Modern tendency implics teff restrictions for artists by various reasons. I cannot agree with this position as I firmly believe that artists shouldn't be limited in their activity anyway. 
Firstly, artist is a human being which has its own view of reality and in case it doesn't correspond to this "official position" and its author is punished. The results of creative activity will not disappear and the artist won't change his view. This creative activity will become marginal but it won't disappear at all. The example of Solzenitsin confirms it. By suppressing some views, government creates problems for itself as it is difficult to know whether the works of this author are popular or not because they are out of law. 
Secondly, anyway arts exist for people, for "mass consuming" and government restrictions focus on this kind of arts. So this sphere is regulated by rules of market and "unneccessary" works will dissappear itself without any demand. In this case government just should keep an eye on art tendencies without depriving the society of what it wants. Market will regulate itself, setisfying the public demands without our restrictions. Any government invasion will cause additional interest to what can possibly be not interesting at all. 
To sum it all up, government shouldn't restrict rules for artists and break the freedom of expression as these measures just create some unneccessary problems for government and, what is more importante, art sphere may perfectly regulate itself without some limitations.
