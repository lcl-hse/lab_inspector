Some people don't have these time. Furthemore, to become stronger you should have some diet, if you don't, any sport facilities can't help you. On the other hand, without a huge number of sport facilities, you can't find you sport, which you like and which is more usefull for you. So people will not doing sport well and then it will be a result of small effect for them. Another reason of small effect is wrong timetable.
