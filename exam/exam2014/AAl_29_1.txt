The line graph gives an information about the amount of people over 65 years old basing on the statistic data of three countries: Japan, Sweden and the United States of America. 
According to the graph, the amount of people from the presented age group in Japan steadily fell in the period from 1940 to 1985. However, there is a serious increase in the population of people aged 65 from 3% in 1985 to 28% in 2040. The population of this age group in Sweden also grew from 1940 to 2040 from 7% to almost 27%. The amount of such people in the United States slightly increased from 9% to 15% in the period from 1940 to 1980. Then the number of people from age group was more or less stable and, as it is shown on the graph, there is a sharp growth of it in the time period from 2025 to 2040. 
To sum up, the population of people aged 65 and over will significantly increase in presented countries to 2040.
