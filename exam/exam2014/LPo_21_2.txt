These days a situation on the carreer market changed significantly compared with a generation ago. Some of professions become more common only among females, despite another starts more assosiated with males. So some people believes that universities should have the same number of males and females in every subject. I totally disagree with this opinion and in this essay I will support my point of view with examples. 
To begin with, there is a sphere of profession which are easier to master for females. What I mean is that women prefer to work more with people and shits of papers, they can't do hard muskul work. More over, children want to see woman as teachers at school despite the opinion that females more kind and deals with kids better. However, men mostly good at technic work, something like repairing cars or writing computer programms. Another words, different genders will be success if different spheres of work. 
Another argument is that men understand maths better then women, which sometimes can't graduate a university in mathematic or programms. Equal number of male and female students leads to the situation when lots of people give their universities up. 
Thirdly people should be interested in the subject which they learn. What I mean, some people have to enter the university programm what they want like because there are no places in the programm what they want. That can be cause of unhappy society of country. 
Taking everything into consideration, people should not have any fames to change their carrier ways. To be success they should be free in the opportunity to choose. Some professions are better for women or men, so they should enter the university program which they want to.
