Nowadays people become to realize the importance of health problem. So, there are a heated debates around the problem of public health. Generally, there are two points of view on this problem. Some people think that to solve this problem we need to create more sports facilities, others - are sure that it is not enough. Personally, I agree to the second idea but the first should not be forgotten. 
To begin with, sports facilities are very important. Lots of people are willing for going in for sport to improve their health, but have no opportunity to do it. So, by creating new sports facilities we allow people, who is willing, to keep their shape and train to prevent health problems. But, from my point of view, the problem is more complicated than just a shortage of sports facilities. 
From the other point of view, the problem is in modern way of life. Other words, modern people do not want to go in for sport or fitness, or have no possibility because of lack of time. So, to solve these problems it is not sufficient to build more sports facilities. We should create such condition, that will make lots of people change their daily routine and begin to care about their health. To solve such a problem, we can begin, for instance, the advertising of healthy way of life in schools and mass media or to create national physical examinations, that will be an obligatory for every citizen. In any case, to improve public health something more complex that just an increasing the number of sports facilities should be done. 
Taking all arguments into account, this is rather controversial problem. All in all, both positions have advantages and drawbacks, but as far as I'm concerned, increasing the number of sports facilities will not solve the problem.
