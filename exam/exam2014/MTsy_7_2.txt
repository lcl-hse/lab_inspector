The question of public health is very reasonable and important nowadays. Thus the society has some ways to solve this problem. Some people think about and suggest on making sport facilities more popular. Others, nevertheless, insist on other varieties. 
No doubt that we cannot ignore the fact about optimistic results of trainings, sport games and so forth on human health. It helps our body to keep fit and to live longer. These years, mostly in Russia, a great amount of sports events are taking part. To take an example, the Olimpics in Sochi, International Students Games and etc. In addition, I would like to pay attention to the importance and strong influence of sport on children, the future of our planet and human being. 
But, on the other hand, if we give up an opinion about sport, we will find a lot effective opportunities to make public health increased. Having thought about the youth, we are able to enter the extra class in schools connected with healthy diet, knowledge about the way our body works and its necessary needs. We should make our medicine system exist better and develop faster. 
As far as I am concerned, this problem can't be solved only by one specific measure. From my point of view, the best way to improve public health is increase level of each reasonable cause. In other words, people should insist on the healthy lifestyle including spot, diet, relax, eight hours of sleeping, spending time outdoors and so forth. 
So, judging by both point of views, we should remember that the goal can be reched by a variety of ways. But the most effective is by every opportunities and possibilities at the same time. Anyway, enjoy your life in every aspects and don't give up anything!
