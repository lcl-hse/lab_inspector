It is no secret to anyone that creativity plays a dominant role in almost every sector of artist's life. These persons are needed for permanent freedom in order to display their talent. There mustn't be any penalties for their expressions, because any kind of art considers to be a masterpiece and not contains and violence or unpleasant thing. 
First, the every idea, providing by an artist provides a very deep phylosophy. Every picture we see in museum or film we are watching is an artist's sending for us. The master want to teach us, to transfer their own experience and thoughts. Each idea is like a sign for the humanity, which we cannot reject. 
Second, numerous masterpieces form the culture of every country. It makes each country unic, glorious and bright. Maintaining of artist's masterpieces, in my opinion, is one of the most important goals of a government. They should carefully preserve their artists, making them all conditions for good work. For example, we have great number examples of brilliant poets, who leaved our country and lived in Europe and USA, in case of terrible restrictions of the Stalin's government in 1920 - 1930s. 
Third, every artist's idea is only way to say what he think. Nowadays, we are leaving in modern democratic society, which means freedom for art expressions, too. Neither picture or poem, each peace of art is a unic person's idea, which all of us should respect. Disrispect of person's thoughts may lead to totalitarian policy system, in which all people will suffer. 
Finally, we must undertand the importance of art in our life. Art is that thing, which makes us wise, maintain our intelligence and literacy and simply makes us true man. Art can teach us how to live, how to survive and how to respect all people around us. Thus, There no place for any restriction of any kind of art.
