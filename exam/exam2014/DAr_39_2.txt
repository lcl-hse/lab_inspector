Public health is a burning problem nowadays: government makes different policies but the level of public health is still low. There are different opinions and all of them should be take into account. The most common opinion is that the best way to improve public health is by increasing of sports facilities. It is obvious that sport helps us to become healthier. We have a lot of opportunities in our everyday life. The sphere of fitness is very popular nowadays but it is very expensive. Not all people can efford it. If government provides more cheap facilities, more people will use it and it will lead to improve in public health. I agree with this opinion, I tend to believe that it is the best way to solve this problem. Another people argue that this would have little effect on public health. They choose other ways to improve of them. One of these ways is reduce prodaction of unhealthy or junk food. All of us know this food influence on our health and destroy it. If people avoid to it unhealthy food and eat more fruits and vegetables, it will increase the level of public health. Another way to improve public health is to make some informative advertisements, useful films and books. Some people have no idea how to improve their health and these resources can help them to do it. In conclusion I should say that it is very difficult to choose the best way to improve public health. All these ways should be used together. The government should controll the level of public health and provide people more opportunities and facilities.
