The pie-charts provide information on the proportions of age groups in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and their predictions for 2050. In 2000 approximately half of the Yemen's population consisted of youngsters under 14 years. The rest of population were mostly the middle-aged adults from 15 to 59: 46,3% the oldest group of population aged over 60 took only 3,6% of the whole. However, a different picture is forecast for the year 2050: the largest group of population - the kids aged under 14 - will probably reduce in comparison with year 2000 while the other groups will probably both increase up to 57,3% and 5,7% correspondingly. The demographical situation in Italy is different from Yemen: in 2000 over a half of population consisted of the middle-aged. The percentage of children was significantly smaller than in Yemen: 14,3%. The oldest people took about one forth. In 2050 the part of middle-aged adults will reduce as well as the kids part giving place to the oldest which will almost double.
