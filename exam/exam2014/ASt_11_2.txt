Nowadays the most of the universities allow almost everyone, who passed exams successfully, to study. It doesn't depend on sex. However, there is some disbalance, for example male are mostly graduating engeneering or math faculties, and women in turn non-mathematical directions. Thus some people claim that there should be equal quotes for each faculty and destinations, which I completely disapprove. 
To begin with, I strongly believe that male and female candidates have to have an equal rights and opportunities to enter a university. Moreover, they should be allowed to choose the program they want to study by themselves and any restrictions in this way are inacceptable. There are a few women, desiring to study engeneering, however this question is quite attractive for men. Thus, owing to this quotes adjustement there would be a kind of discrimination, when women could easily enter a university and men - could not. The last but not the list is that, after entering the university, students are allowed to change the program, choosing the most interesting for them. This fact only proves that the inequality existed is natural. 
However, those, who deny these obvious facts, spot on the social reasons why the number of male and female accepted have to be equal. One of the most significant of them is that it is much easier to create a family, when there is an equal amount of male and female students at the one destination. In my opinion, university is not the only place to meet your boy or girlfriend, hence, I find this argument as not very convincing. 
In conclusion, I want to underline, that everyone have a freedom of choice and given an opportunity to enter any university in spite of the sex. And I think that we should not make any discrimination only due to the fact that the numbers of male and female students on different faculties is different.
