We are given the chart that illustrate an average level of electricity consume in winter and summer in England and pie-chart that provides a reasons of it's using. 
Despite an overall jumping of the graph, the figures are characterized by a number of peaks and thoughts. Firstly, it hits a peak in the winter's evenings, when it reach more then 40000 units. The less necessity of electricity we can see in summer days. But the main trend of electricity in two times higher then in summer. 
More then half of using electricity spends to making warm in living rooms and heating water. Almast the same percentage of units of electricit people use for electric tools, lightning, gadgets etc. 
To conclude, I would like to say that electricity is one of the most important factors in everyday life it's hard to imagine our being without it.
