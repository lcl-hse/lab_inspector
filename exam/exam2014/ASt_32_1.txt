The table illustrates data about the underground railway system in six different cities. 
First, it is important to emphasize that London Underground is the oldest one, built in 1863, and has the longest route of 394 km. in spite of being the oldest and longest it has only 775 million passengers per year, while in Paris and Tokyo there are 1192 and 1927 respectively. Paris metro is the second largest on the list. Though Paris and Tokyo underground railway system carry so much passengers every year their length is still around 2 times less than the one in London. Washington DC has got a quite long system which was constructed In 1976, but it's very interesting that it carries only 144 million people per year. 
We also have two rather new and very small railway system in Koyoto and Los Angeles. Koyoto metro is only 11 km long and it's around 40 times shorter than London Underground. Los Angeles has the newest system, built in 2001. 
In conclusion, it's important to say that every city on the list had some peculiar features in their underground railway system which probably depend on the specific purpose for which the system was constructed.
