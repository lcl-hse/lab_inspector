The question about improving national health is very important in our life. More than that this problem is quite controvertial. Some people consider that increasing amount of sports facilities is the greatest way to improve the health of society. But other people thing, that alternative ways are required. On the one hand, sport is a very useful measure for improving people's health. For example, if children spend a lot of their free time outdoors, they will be stronger. Due to different sport activities the illness can be redused. More than that, different sports like football or basketball is not only healthy, but it is also very interesting. On the other hand, sport is just a part of healthy lifestyle. If people want to improve their health, they should remember about healthy diet. First of all, government should provide clear water to all regions of the country and avoid different products with GMO. Moreover, people should eat more vegetarian products and don't allow them fride food. Another measure is properly treatment and good medical servise. As for me, I agree, that sport is essential part of healthy lifestyle and it is important measure for improving national health. But of course, we should not forget about other ways to improve public health, such as healthy diet and good public medical service. To conclude, I should say, that all measures need to work as a system. Only in this way high public health would be reached.
