The four graphs show us the persentage of ages population in two country in two period of time. In Yemen and Italy in 2000 and in 2050 years. Of course the persentages in 2050 it is expected share. 
The main trend in Yemen in bouth period of time is small persentage of people whous more than sixthy so in 2000 this share was 3,6 persent and in 2050 this persent will increas by 5,7. And is obveously that we can see that the daminunt group is change. If in 2000 more than half of population was children who no more then 14, in 2050 the dominant share will be people who age betwen 15-59 yers. 
The population in Italy older than in Yemen in bothe period of time. So the persentag of oldest people (who more than 60) more than 10 persent as in 2000 as in 2050. The prefious share is population who in the middele age group (betwean 15-59) it's share is 61,6 and 46,2 persentuge in this period of time. 
Obveously there is no some trend wich is conect this two country, becouse the populations of country depends of many factors, wich different in Yemen and Italy.
