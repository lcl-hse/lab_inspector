Nowadays a lot of young people are willing not to lose any time of their lifes. So many students decide to work or travel before going to the university. 
First of all it is understandable that huge amount of youngsters encouraged to get as much experience as possible by any means nessessery. of course it is a bright idea that travelling arround tha world could halp to broaden the hirrizond of person. Also it helps to be providen with different cultural specialities and to learn some foreign languages as well. Also working is an important deal. Youth who decided to work for a year before going to the university probably would be influenced by working processes such as negotiations, working in a team, dealing with different advanced task. Besides that it could help to deal with time limits. Surely it will hwlp students in further education. 
However there is some disadvantages in this lind of proccess. Firstly many people argue that taking a year off before going to university could be harmful because huge amount of knowledge which was occupied during the school is likely to be forgotten Besides that there isb a threat that many students who decided to work and travel basically will never attend the university at all. 
In my opinion this kind of life experiancing trip is sagnificant and useful from my experience of a yongsters manager of the HP company it is crystal clear that getting knowledge about the world or working is absolutely great. I've worked for an year in HP company and it helped me to furfill need of my current professors and to avoid misunderstanding with them. Besides I never miss time limints. 
To sum it up there are advantages and diadvantages conserning this problem but as for me a number of significant skills could be learned by using this method. All of them will be useful in the future education
