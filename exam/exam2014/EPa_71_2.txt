Some people consider that it is better to increase public health by sitting more sports facilities than some other measures. Others say that it is not the best way of it. But I suppose that there is no need to improve public health by increasing the number of sports facilities. Other methods are more effective. 
Some people convinced that the best measure to increase public health is by setting more sports facilities. It is because they regard sport as the most useful in this case. People spending more time on doing sport will spend less time on dealing with some electronical gadgets that have a great negative effect on out health, they think. Moreover, new sports facilities set on the streets, may be, will attract bigger number of people to train and will improve public health in the whole. 
As for the contrast point of new, some other methods are more effective. People who think so say that the best way to improve public health is to make them eat more healthy and natural food, for example. Also they suppose that this increasing number of sports facilities will not help for everyone, because there are a lot of elder people who cannot doing sport properly. Also they say that such things as air and nater pollution and proper sleeping have bigger influence on people's health. So to improve public health it is better to use other measures. 
And I think that it is better to use other methods.
