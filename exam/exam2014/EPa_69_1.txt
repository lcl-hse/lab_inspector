The diagrams demonstrate the percentage of population in Yemen and Italy according to age in 2000 and 2050. The data analyses reveals that people aged 15-59 dominated over other age categories in two countries. 
Considering the first diagram approximately a half of population in Yemen in 2000 were children and teenagers. This figure is forecasted to fall up to 37% in 2050. The number of adults is predicted to reach the maximum point of 57,3% in 2050 in Yemen, compared to Italy with only 46,2%. 
Regarding the criteria of population aged 0-14 in Italy marks are much more varied. There was a negligible margin between marks in 2000 and 2050 which is nearly 2,8%. The percentage of old people (60+ years) will significantly increase during the period of 50 years: 24,1% in 2000 compared to 42,3% in 2050. 
Summarising preceding arguments, an overall trend is that most of the age categories are forecasted to grow till 2050 (with standard deviation 10-15%), expect children in Yemen (decrease by 13%).
