To begin with, in 2000 the percentage of people of 0-14 and 15-59 ages living in Yemen were approximately the same. The proportion of an older people was rather small (3,6%). However, the situation are expected to change and the number of 15-59 aged people will increase from 46,3% to 57,3%. At the same time, the proportion of older generation will rise too on about 2,1%. 
More dramatically changes are predicted to exist in Italy. The number of 15-59 aged persons will decrease from 61,6% to 46,2% and the proportion of 60 and more aged people will double in 2050.
