There is an opinion that governments should give freedom to creative art express their own ideas, such as create a music, or draw a picture, the way they want to do. 
Historically came, that artists always have been restricted by government or reach people. They lived poor and died poor, only after they died became famous and reach. For example todays well known Leonardo Davinchi restricted by the king of Italy. 
First of all, it is obvious that if government gives money and freedom to the artists, we will have many creative pictures and musics, which will improve the people power of mind. It would be beautifull country, where freedom of creative artists woulkd be allowed. It can be imagined beautifull buikdings, creative pictures everywhere. It woulkd be amazing. 
On the other hand, many of artists is insane so if government gives them freedom, it would be very dangerous for our mind. For example, some insane artists want to draw the nude women on the buildings. This picture would be reasoning of some injury on the mind of the children. 
To sum it up, it can be seen that freedom to create is amazing, but there should be some restrictions to not allow awful arts.
