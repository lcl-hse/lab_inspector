There is no doubt that happiness is the most imortant thing in whole life. Many people suppose that happiness is a key to total success in live: not money, not characteristics, but only happiness. But others do not agreed. They said happiness is a complex thing and no one can define what happiness actually is. 
In my humble opinion, happiness indeed is a key ti success. I believe that happiness include good health, good relationships with friends and parents. 
In majority cases people tend to agree with position like my, but there are a lot of people which are constantly disagree. 
Happiness depends on good health. By and large, good health helps to keep moving forvard and never give up. More over, happiness is a feeling when you achieve success. That's why it is so important to be fan of your own work, love your job and be totally inspired. 
Happiness as for me never depends on money, or wealthness, at whole. But money is a important tool effording to achieve total success. I want to highlight, that you can be poorman but happy, and, you can became rich, but never be happy. It's not by chance, a lot of richmen have personal phsy-couch. 
From where I stand, I think happiness cannot define completely. As fsr as I'm concerned, level of happiness each person choose for themselves. I think that's very debatable and I can't directly and cleanly give you answer on this question.
