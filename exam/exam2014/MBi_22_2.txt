Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. 
Nowadays the situation in the universities shows that not every speciality can accept equal parts of male and female students. This topic is worth to discussion. 
On the hand, I partly agree with that because of its ambiguity. Technical universities attract mostly male applicants and than students. The humanity specialities have mostly female one. It is obvious that such a situation should be because male students are interested in practical education and female students in female practical skills, for example, literary, painting, history, languages. 
On the other hand, I can hardly agree with such a position. Most of teachers, for instance, who teach literary studies are male ones. Moreover, there are a lot of female researchers in physics, maths and other "male" specialities. For this reason the universities can accept numbers of different students, who want to be taught by these skills. 
In conclusion I would like to notice that it is not important, which population is leading on which speciality. I think if student has a great interest in different studies, the universities should explain them that and give this opportunity. Another reason is that the government wants thaeir stidents to part in equal proportion in every subject necause of wish to have equal numbers of specialists in every subject. This reason can be but I prefer another one which is to do what students want. In another words such a theme is very popular and actual in recent years.
