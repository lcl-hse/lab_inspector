Some people assume that one crucial way of improving public health is to enlarge sports facilities. Others are against this assertion claiming that there are different and more efficient measures to cope with the problem. I definitely suppose that increasing sports facilities would have little effect of public health. 
Firstly, growing number of gyms will attract people and they will start a healthy way of life. Secondly, public will see that too much attention is paid to increasing sports facilities and people will support this policy ot government. 
Nevertheless, it is not the only way to improve public health. For instance, public is affected through the mass-media and one of the best ways out is to ban ads with cigarettes and alchogol and even to put censorship or some channels. Moreover, people themselves should change their way of life and mentality for a healthier one. It will be vital example for children to see their parents doing sports every day. Furthermore, public health is greatly influenced by eating habits and cuisine. Every person should include vegetables and fruits in his/her meals and balance them with fiber and vitamins in order to be healthy. 
Summarising preceding arguments, I strongly believe that there is the diversity of measures to improve public health, not only to increase the number of sports facilities. Public health goes from the inner world of every individual, because "in a healthy body there is a healthy mind".
