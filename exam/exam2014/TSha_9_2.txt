Generally speaking, there are many discussions about a gender discrepancy in universities nowadays. It could be seen that there are a jreat disbalance between women and men in some subjects such as education or engineering. It is connected with a gender discrimination and many people want to end up with it. 
From my point of view, it is obvious and normal that there are different numbers of girls and boys students in some subjects such as life-risk activities or really hard jobs that are unsuitable for women or men due to their physical characteristics. It is impossible for women to lift 100 kilo weijht things. However, there are some exceptions in each sphere, but it is more connectable with the Record Books. 
Despite the fact there are some exceptions and unique situations, it is unfair to appreciate one gender more than the other. In many countries there are no discrepancy between male and female - only really intelligent, smart and talented people enter the university. If this rule is done, the situation will fair because there are no difference with gender a person is - the main idea is about his or her talent and abilities.
It could be seen that I am against gender discrimation, but only really good-motiveted students should be accepted by universities and it does not matter which his or her gender is. Nowadays there are big numbers of works and jobs where could be employed male and female persons at the equal level.
