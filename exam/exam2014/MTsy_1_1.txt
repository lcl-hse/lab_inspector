The pie charts show the information on the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050. There are two charts for Yemen and two charts for Italy, that give us an information about persantage of people under 14 years old, 15-59 years and people elder then 60 years old. 
As a pie chart of Yemen's population shows, the persantage of teenagers (0-14 years) is approximately a half from the whole population - 50.1%. Then goes persantage of people 15-59 years that reaches 46.3 percent. The smallest group of people is population over 60 years old - only 3.6%. However, projections for 2050 differ substantionally. The persantage of adult people (15-59 years) will increase for more than a half from all population - about 57.3 per cent. People with age under 14 years will have about 37%. The persantage of elder people will not vary dramatically. 
There is another situation in Italy. The persantage of people aged 15-59 dominates in 2000 (61,6%) and will dominane constantly (46.2%) in the future. Nevertheless, there is a big difference with people over 60 years. In 2000 this persantage (60+) is only 24,1%, when it will achieve 43% in 2050. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that such pie charts show us that our population is becoming elder. Those, who was teenagers in Yemen in 2000 will become aged 15-59 years in 2050. So do people in Italy. 15-59 years in 2000 and over 60 years in 2050.
