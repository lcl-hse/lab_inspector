This graph gives us information about percentage of population older 65 years from 1940 to 2040 in 3 countries such as Japan, Sweden and USA. It can be seen some interesting trends. 
Firstly, the percentage of population in all of the observed countries will increase significantly to the period of the 2040-s. For example, in Japan which will leave the highest proportion of people aged 65 and more 27%, this amount will rise on almost 22% in the comparison with 1940. As for another two countries, both of them will leave steady increase in 2030 - by almost 5 percent. 
Nevertheless, we can observe some decreases between 1980 and 1990 in Sweden and USA. Population in these states slightly decline from 14 to 13% and from 15 to 14% respectively. Whereas, in Japan it was period of steadiness during to almost 25 years (1960-1985) after dropping from 5 to 3 percent. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that all in all this graph indicates rather positive trend in increasing population aged 65 and older.
