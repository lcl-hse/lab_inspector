Nowadays many schools face a problem which is connected with their students behaviour. Sometimes students can be rude, and impolate. However, there are some reasond why do the students behave so and some ways of sollution of this question. 
The first thing I want to mention is that parents should spend more time with their children and teach them how to behave in different social spheres. Nowadays, parents always on work and busy and sometimes they do not have time on their children. That is why a young person started to teach himself as he can; and the most common way to do so is Internet. Today internet provide a lot of information, which is sometimes is not suitable for a child. For instance, if child always watch some videos, films, where are rude and impolate people are a main characters he will act in the same way as they do. 
Another point is that student do not see his teacher as a head, as a leader. Sometimes teachers try to be really kind and nice, but in many cases students do not appriciate such behaviour and started to be have more rude and feel more free in conversation with a teacher. I personally believe, that teacher is a very difficult profession, because he must be kind and strickt at once. 
Undoubtedly, there are solutions for such problem. For example parents should try to spend more time with their children, or if this option is impossible, they should take their child to a varios sport or art activities, where he can get to know how to communicate right. Moreover, the head of a school should also somehow be involved in process. In his oportunity to employee only a professional teachers, and, if such problem exist in his school, he should try to explain to a student where he is wrong, and maybe somehow help him to become kind and polate person. 
To sum up students way of behavior can be a real problem not only for school, even for the society in future. That is why his behavior should be controlled by parents or by school-employers.
