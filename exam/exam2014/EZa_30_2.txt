In modern time happiness is the most important thing for many people. Success in career,achievements in sports, high social status and etc - all of it cqan involve in formula of happiness. I think, everyone has own opinion about happiness and thus it is very difficult to define it. However, I try to show which factors help to understand or define own formula of happiness and achieve it. First of all, people should think about their targets. If someone wants to be athlete,he should train much as possible. If someone wants to earn a lot of money, he should be creativy and pragmatic. On first view it is easy to find target and create plan. But life is moire difficult and people used to reorganise own activities and change targets. 
Moreover, people should to be less serious. Of course, if someone has important task, he should be serious. It relates to scientists, doctors, policemenand etc. 
However, people need to understand that life conditions may change and they will used to live with it. If people will be not serious, they will be less sressful and nervous, when they review own targets. 
Furthermore, when someone define own targets, he should find right instruments to achieve it. If someone wants to be famous, but do nothing or don't have any talent, theycheck false target. People should realise own possibilities. 
Thus, it can be concluded, that it is very difficult to define happiness. It is very important to see own abilities, realiuse possibilities and find right target. Targets define a sense of life.
