The bar chart illustrates the different levels of post-school qualifications in Australia between men and women in 1999. 
It can be seen from the chart that the number of men had the skilled vocational diploma is essential: males made up 90 per cent from all who had such diploma. In comparison with it, 70 per cent of females had the undergraduate diploma. Moreover, women dominated in getting Bachelor's degree (over 55 per cents from total number of people). 
However, in the last two post-school qualifications (postgraduate diploma and Master's degree) the number of females was fewer than the number of men who held them. It is clear from the graph that there were only 30% and 40% of women who held the postgraduate diploma and the Master's degree. 
Overall, the post-school qualifications in Australia according to gender in 1999, tended to be men-dominated as in three from five qualifications the number of men helded them was significantly larger than the number of females.
