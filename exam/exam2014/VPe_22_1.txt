In the first chart given we can see how many students of different ages study in order to get a good job and to make a career and how many of them study for interest. And the second chart shows the per cent of employer support students of each age are given. 
In the first chart we can see that the older students are the les of them study for career and the more for interest. So, the number of students under 26 studying for career is four times as high as the same number but over 49. And among the number of the students studying for themselves, for interest we can see a steady increase from adolescents to elderly people. 
From the second chart we can assume that the biggest quantity of support is given to employees under 26 and the smallest - to those between 30 - 39. After 26 years there can be observed a slight decrease in the quantity of employer support and after 39 everything is wise - versa. The biggest quantity of support given is around 64 per cent and it is about 30 per cent higher than the lowest point. 
These two charts show that most youngsters study to build a career, whereas the elderly people prefer studying for themselves. And furthermore, this factor is provide also by employers who give most support to the youths.
