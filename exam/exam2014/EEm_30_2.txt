For many hundreds years, since ancience women and men were parfed, and this was linked with the physical and mental things. So nowadays we can feel the rest of this division too. Men are strong and clever in science, women are fragile and they can be strong in arts. It's a great stereotype of the present and we have to solve it, because people of different sex should have equal rights. We can begin to solve the problem of equality at schools and universities. Let's stop on the last. 
Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. As it was said, it can solve the problem of unequalty between men and women. And now it can be said this problem is almost solved. the movement of feminism in the middle of the 20th centure did a great deal. 
On the other hand if universities will accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject we will get different specious market of workers. Why is it good? Nowadays, for example, at schools there are more teachers that are women and it's dull as possibly, men are more talented in some things. It's productive to get equal promotion of specialists between men and women.
