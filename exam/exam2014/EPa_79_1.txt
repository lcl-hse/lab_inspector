The four chart show a comparison beetween the two countries - Yemen and Italy - on the different age groups and also a forecast for the year 2050. They represent three groups - children, adults and old people. As we can see, in 2000 both countries have a signifact number of people between 15 and 59 years: 46,3% in Yemen and 61,3% in Italy. It is estimated that by 2050, these numbers will almost "switch" between the countries, Yemen will have 57,3% and Italy will have 46,2%. The countries have a noticable contrast when it comes to old people and children. In 2000, Yemen had about a half of its population being no older than 14. Also, the rate of old people was extremely low - 3,6%. In Italy, however, people older than 60 represent about a quarter of the total population and children under 15 are only 14,3% of it. 
As far as the forecast goes, by 2050 in Yemen, the number of people aged 60 or more will slightly change to 5,7%, whereas the amoant of children will drop to a little more than a third of the population Italy shows a whole different situation: the rate of old people will almost double by 2050, when the figures for adults and children under 15 will drop by 15,4% and 2,8%, respectively. Yemen is predicted to show a growth in the number of adults as well as people over 60. This growth is estimated to be 11%.
