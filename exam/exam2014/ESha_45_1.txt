The pie charts illustrate the population in different ages in Yemen and Italy, in 2000 and its projections for 2050. 
The main trend in that there was a significant difference in the proportion of it in 2000 and, according to the forecast, it will also be in 2050. However, the percentage of people in different ages inside the countries will totally change. For instance, a half of Yemen's population in 2000 was at the age between 0 and 14 years, but by 2050 this number will decrease rapidly and will be only 37%. At the same time part of population in Yemen (15-59 years old) will increase from 46,3% to 57,3%. The percentage of elderly people will remain aproximately constant in both periods. 
The changes in Italian demographic situation will be as vibal as Yemen's ones: the majority of its population was about 15-59 years old in 2000, but, according to the forecast, the decline of it will be significant it will be less than a half of all population by 2050. However, the percentage of elderly people will increase twofold In 50 years. Children on both pie charts are not more than 15% of all Italian people. 
To sum up, demographic situation in both developed Italy and developing Yemen will greatly change in 50 years between 2000 and 2050. However, these changes are not the some, according to scientific projections.
