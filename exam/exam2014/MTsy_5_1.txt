The diagrams illustrate the ages of people living in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and predict the situation until 2050. 
In 2000 about a half of the population of Yemen were people from 15 to 59 years old. While in Italy there were more than 60% of these people. 
It is predicted that until 2050 the proportion of people from 15 to 59 years old in Yemen will increase to 57,3%. And in Italy, opposite, the proportion of these people will decline to 46,2%. 
In 2000 in Yemen there were only 3,6% of people older than 60 years old. While in Italy there were about one-fourth of elderly people. It is predicted, to 2050 this proportion in Yemen will rise to 5,7%, while in Italy the proportion of elderly people will increase dramatically to 42,3%. 
In 2000 in Yemen there were approximately a half of people from 0 to 14 years old. In Italy this proportion was about 14%. It is expected that until 2050 the proportion of this people will decrease sharply to 37% in Yemen while in Italy it will decline a little bit. 
To sum up, it is seen that the population in Italy is becoming older and in Yemen it is becoming younger.
