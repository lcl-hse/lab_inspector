Arts, music and science come along with creativity and it's a good question should the government set any bounds and restrictions to keep the artists in a safe area? What is allowed is always defined by political conditions, culture and society. I suppose some limitations are indispensable when we talk about the mass media, literature, movies and the Internet. 
Humans are great thinkers, leaders and affectors. The ones who are creative and are also able to pursuade the crowd to do what they want may become dangerous for the government. To avoid these problems, there should be should be some limitations for creative artists in media. Let's rememberremember some movies or books and paintings that had a great influence on us in the past. What did we feel then? What emotions could such things cause? Certainly, if a movie producer showed us the true story about our life, with all its problems, sorrows, wars and disgust, lots of poor people who were somehow represented in the movie, would have understood their misery and would also have blamed the govs in all their problems. Maybe that's true and the government is the one to blame, but such movies wouldn't probably give us any way out, any appropriate solution. The effect however may be devasting. I mean, riots, wars, murders and so on. 
Another argument against freedom for creative artists is the effect of what they show us through their work especially the effect on the youth. Young people's consciousness is not ready to process this information wisely. As a result we will get nervous, sick, stressful boys and girls. 
However these restrictions shouldn't be unreasonable. Thoughts of creative people may change the world and make it a better place to live in. As one if such famous people said a couple of weeks ago: " We'd like to make the world move open and connected". So why not? We must be wise and cautious, of course, but not to se enemies at every corner.
