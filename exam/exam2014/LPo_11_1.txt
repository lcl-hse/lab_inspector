The line graph illustrated the percentage of elder people over 65 every 20 years since 1940 till 2040 in three various countries. 
Overall, during this period the USA and Sweden have made progress almost in the same way, while Japan will have risen from the lowest place by 2040 and will have had the biggest proportion of population aged 65 and over. 
Initially in 1940 all three countries had 5-10% of pensioners, however then this amount began to grow slightly in two of them and in Japan it fell down. In the 1980s there were around 15% of old people in the USA and Sweden, while in Japan there was only about 3%. By the beginning of 21st century the percentage in Sweden and America intersected (almost 15%). In third country it began to increase sharply by this time. In last decade (the 2030s) there will be 10% of people over 65 in Japan and around 10% more in Sweden and the USA. In 2040 all countries will have about 25% of pensioners and it will be a great success in compare with the 1940s.
