Nowadays, the modern art has become one of the most interesting themes to speek about. Some people say that creators should not be restricted by any rules while they are expressing themselfs. Others disagrees, because that think that everyone have to obbey the official and ethical laws. 
In the past, there were some types of laws that were censoring all pieces of art that was done. Artists could not do anything that was not allowed and many interesting books and films were hiden from the public because of this reason. 
At the same time, if the artists will gain totall freedom in expressing their ideas it could be not very good for people around them. For example, writing a book with a personal point of view on some religion can hurt feelings of the prayers. The artists should think about what they do and to what extent they should express their thoughts. 
As I think, there should be some rules which artists have to keep in mind. It is very important to do something like goverment restrictions in creative sphere very carefuly and what is more nessesery. Art helps people, for instance, to relax or to find out something new so it should have particular freedom. But some cases should not be allowed. 
In conclusion, I accept one phrase as the main rule while creating something : "Think about others." If you can think that your piece of art is higher than any rule in the world, you can touch someone's feelings in the wrong way, so the person will only argue against you and your point of view.
