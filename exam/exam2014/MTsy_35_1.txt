These pie charts illustrate the differencies in the number of people in three age groups during the period of half of the century. Also, this information is given about Yemen and Italy. 
The biggest slice in today's Yemen age group's structure belongs to people between 15 and 59 years old. In 2050 this slice is going to grow by 11%. It's connected with the reducing percentage of youngsters between 0 and 14. As we can see, the number of old people increases slowly. 
Italy has some similar age group's proportions with Yemen today but in the future these ones are totally opposite. The biggest part of Italy's population is a group between 15-59 but it is going to fall to the percentage of 46.2% in 2050. The number of old people will increase much by 18.2%. Moreover, the children's slice is decreased just by about 3%. 
To sum up, this demographic situation can tell us that Yemen is going to have more people of the working age than Italy and much less old pensioners. In my opinion, it has a positive impact for the economical situation in Yemen.
