Public heath is one of the major characteristics of the societies. The problem of ways to increase it is extremely essential for every governments. There are people who believe that it may be done by increasing the number of sports facilities, but there are some who argue that it will be not very effective solution. I suppose that it is a good idea. It will make the sport more available, but on the other hand, we also need a some kind of promotion of sport. 
There are many people who would like to going for sports, but have no facilities neare their houses for doing it. This problem can be solved by building new sport areas such as fitness clubs, swimming pulls, dance classes and others. It will give an opportunity to many people to become healthier. 
This way to solve the problem can be not very effective because there are also people who do not like sport. That is why we need to make an additional actions to describe them why it is useful to be interested in some kind of sports. One of ways to do this is a social advertasing. Also, we can use some celebrities to show that sport is extremly popular in our days. Such essential part of social life as halth should be always controlled by the government. It must act in two directions: to provide us with the needed facilities and to promote health life style and sports.
