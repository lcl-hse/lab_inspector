There are different views on artists' freedom : some people people suppose, that they could do everything they want and that there shouldn not be any rules connected with this; on the other hand, there is an opinion that there should be strict social controls on creative people. As regards to me, I believe that rules and restrictions kill creativity and in this essay I will explain my point of view, using some examples from life. 
At first, people in governments usually do not understand species of art at all. They are not competetive in this shere and cannot be experts in questions of art. For example, nowadays in Russia some of modern exhibitions are closed because governments thought that they are bad and dangerous for people's minds. I find it really dissapointing. 
Another argument for artists' freedom in work is that is the main feature of art process - creating something new. Art is always developing, new kinds and forms of it born every day. So how can governments and political organizations control it? It is evidence that in countries with strict art control and cenzure (like China and the North Corea Republic) art doesn't develop nowadays. 
Meanwhile, artists should look at themselves too and do not produce things, which are evidently harmful for people. It is a difficult question and maybe sometimes official control is relevant. But the best way for artists is to make this control themselves. 
To sum up, I really believe that government restrictions are not necessary, in the vast majority of these questions. Political and social control kill art and developments in this shere.
