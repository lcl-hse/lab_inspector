In today's modern world the role of education become more and more essential. By that fact, the proportion of male and female in educational field starts to be an area of interest for research. Is one gender more succesfull in define subject or not and should universities accept the same quantity of man and woman - are the questions that provoke concerns. I fully agree that they have to. 
In the 20th century there was a few number of female who were allowed to get a higher education. It should be added that the area of that education was restricted - the woman were not able to become a politician or an economist or even to join military collages as well. Nowadays, obviously, the situation has changed and there are a wide range of succesfull woman, who achieved a lot in those fields, such as Margaret Tatcher or Hillary Clinton. They made a lot for their countries. Moreover, nobody could proofe the fact that man are far smarter in math, chemistry and other complicated disciplines, which demand a high mathematical skills. It is usually expected that woman should prefer languages studying or teaching. Nonetheless, the examples of Marie Kurie and others famous Noble-awarded woman present the fact that both genders are equal in scientific researches and there are no visible reason to decline the applications from female students owing to the fact of sex. 
To conclude, I would like to mention that even nowadays the situation is rather different than it was one century ago, some universities carry on accepting more applications from male students in every subject than from females. Although, in civilized European countries the result of accaptance depends only on the state exams marks and not on gender, that gives opportunity to choose students by their educational level ant sorts out the issue of inequality.
