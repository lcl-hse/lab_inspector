The present table provides the data about metros in different countries. The underground railways are compared in term of their age, length and amount of users per year. 
To begin with, the oldest tube is a London's one, which was appeared about 151 years ago. It surves 775 million of city-dwellers and its length is 394 kilometres. It is clear, that the underground railway system in Paris has 199 kilometres of route what is twice as less as the London's metro has. The most demanded tube is in Tokyo, about 1927 inners use it during the year. 
In contrast, subway in Kyoto allows to surve only 45 people per year. In addition it is only 11 kilometres in length, so the Kyoto's metro is the smallest one. 
Overall, it is obvious, that the oldest underground railway systems are larger than the youger as well as they are able to surve more passengers.
