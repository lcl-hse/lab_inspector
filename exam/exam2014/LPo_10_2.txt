Nowadays, everyone can study in a University and it is not depend on sex. However, there are some people, who believe that Universities should accept the same number of boys and girls in every subject. In my opinion this practice would not be successful. 
First of all, I think, there are many subject which are more interesting for boys, or which are more easier for girls. For example, men like engeneering more then arts, so many boys want to study engeneering. In this situation, if Universities should accept equal number of male and female students, it will be impossible for some boys to study what they want. 
Futhermore, to my mind, in some countries there are not equal number of men and women. So if there are much more women in this country, it will be impossible to organize the same number of male and female students in every subject. 
However, some people suppose that equal amount of boys and girls in every subjects make possible to have different specialists in one way, because man and woman have different ways to solve the problems. But In my opinion, there are a lot of only man's professions today, and it is not necessary for women try to work in them. 
Finaly, I want to say that in all Universities all over the World there are not equal number of male and female students in every faculty and in every subject. And I believe that it is right system, because everyone have a chance to study where he/she want and it is not depend on gender.
