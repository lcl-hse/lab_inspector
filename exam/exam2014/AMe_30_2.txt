Some people think that creative artists must be given the freedom to express their own words, pictures, ideas and it is whichever way they wish. Also the goverment must be no restrictions in thing, which they do. 
A lot of artist be nowaday. And majority of they very creative. Some people think they must to express own ideas. I think it is true. A lot of information which tought bad things. But the people who controled for these factors, may do mistakes. A lot of ideas must be show, because a lot of creative artists do thing, which linked with social problem in world. And the forbit do these things it is false. and it is very big mistake. 
I think that goverment must controled this procces. Much things can do the goverment. They can find the good professor, who know how choose a perfectly film, music or pictures. The goverment can help in this. But if only goverment do that, it was uncorrectly. Because only professor in this areas can choose those idea, which will be corectly. 
In conclusion, I want say that I agree and disagree with this opinion, I think that both sentences is correctly, but in this must be rules which help to control all process, which link with choose correctly ideas for pictures, music and film, which do creative artists. And goverment must help and controled this process.
