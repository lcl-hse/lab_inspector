Creative people are the part of our community. They exist through the period of our civilization develpment. Their skills and non-standard mental activity create our cultural history. I allmastly agree thet creative artists should have freedom for their activity. 
First of all, creative artists are not just musicals or poets: there are some philosophers too. It is a kind of people who create an idea. Every new point of view, new emotion or something out of the box is the product which would have influence to people's mind, their opinion, it's the part of a progress. The idea is the reason of inner intention for future acts. Artists may reflect the live of society on their pictures, films or say something, which is not the thing which government want to see. 
We should give creative people as much freedom as we can because the art can talk to people in one language without any words at all. Some artists are famous and every their word make sence for the people because of the same points of view, feelings and emotions. For example, philosophers can generate an ideology of the contry, start the war of stop it. They don't have need to menage the crowd by any agressive methods, but their main advantage is that they have influence on our minds. 
To sum up all of this, I should say that there is no need to take over control creative people. The imagination and individuality is the important thing of oiur history, which should be controlled only by people moral and maybe negative reaction for some things which are unormal for time and mentality of nation.
