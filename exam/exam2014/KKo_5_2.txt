There can be no doubt that sport is important part of our life. Nowadays people are influenced by many unhealthy factors like air pollution, sidentary lifestyle etc. Many people say that sport is a decision of public health problem. But I believe that it is not a way to make population healthy. 
One of the main reasons is that you is what you eat. So right nutrition has a great impact on our health. For example, many people try to lose wait only with help of sport, but they don't successful because balanced diet is required. 
The second consideration is to abandon of unhealthy activities like smoking, alcohol etc. If human bring smoke and has a sport activities in the same time, it can lead to heart disease, because it is very difficult for our health experience so much aggressive factors. Sport cannot fix problems caused by smoking and alcohol. 
On the other hand, sports facilities are very good for our health and mood. They help us to be not only healthy but beautiful and happy. But alone they are not a decision. To make population more healthy, government and everyone personally should take measures to make a better ecological situation, to abandon unhealthy activities like drugs and alcohol and provide us with a balanced diet. 
Ultimately, sport is one of the ways to overcome a problem of public health, but it is not only one. To make good results we should use all measures to make us better.
