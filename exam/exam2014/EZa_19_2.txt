The question about the sense of our being is one of the fundamental and essential questions of philosophy. There is opinion that we should achieve some kind of happiness and live as much as possible happy moments during our life. 
First of all, lets try to difine happiness. It will be hard to do, because there is a difference in the way of perception outer world between people. More over in different cultures in different religions there cannot be similar way to defining happines. For one man the "happy" time can be great time spent with family, for another "happiness" is a great amount of money or chieving words fame. But there is one thing to separate all this thing. When person achieve then, he or she starts to feel only positive emotions. thus we can difine happiness as moment of tome when person "feels good" but, as I said, there is always self-interpretation of happiness. 
The key factor in achieving happiness is not to break Kant's maxima. I mean that you can't use people like tools on your path to happiness, and your happiness always should stay in borders of you, and never affect on freedom and rights of other people. 
Human being is controversial and abstract field of thinking. The question of happiness will always have self-interpretatio, but on the way to it you have to use princip I described earlier. Happiness achieved with it can only be named as "happiness" but what will it be exactly, it is only up to you.
