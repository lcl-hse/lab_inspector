The graphs provide information about age of citizen in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and 2050. It is clear that the youngest population in both cities will reduce and the oldest one will increase. 
From the first two charts we can see that the amount of 15-59 years old people in Yemen will rise approximately on 2 per cent. As for Italy, quantity of people of this age will decrease. However, the index of children (0-14 years) will decrease in 2050 in both countries, on 3% in Italy and on 13% in Yemen. Amount of oldest population in Yemen and Italy will be more than 2050 than in 2000. In Yemen this index will rise on 2 percent and in Italy population of 60+ years will increase approximately in 18 per cent. 
To sum up, we can see that amount of 0-14 and 60+ years people will change at the same way in Yemen and Italy, but the quantity of 15-59 years will rise in Yemen and fall in Italy.
