The table provides information about the underground railway systems, the data of six cities is provided. 
The table shows that London appears to be the first of those cities in which the underground railway station was opened (1863). In Los Angeles, on the contrary, it opened only in 2001, which makes its underground railway system the newest. Another significant feature is the length of route. As we can see from the table London subway is the leader at this point, too (394 km), when the shortest route turns out to be of Kyoto's subway. As for the passengers per year, London's data is also quite impressive, however, the most crowded underground railway station, according to the table is Tokyo's. On contrast, Kyoto's subway has the lowest numbers of passengers per year. 
Overall, London subway turns out to be the oldest and the longest of those represented in the table, while the data of Kyoto's underground railway system in comparison to 6 others leaves much to be desired.
