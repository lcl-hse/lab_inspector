One of the most important question for creative artists of present and past was question about freedom of expressing their own ideas and possibility of restrictions on them. 
Art is the way people can express themself. It is way to present their ideas to people. But at the same time government must protect people. Any danger. The main question become : Can information, that creative artists give to people, dangerous? 
On one hand everyone have to have freedom of their own thoughts. It does not metter, what people think about, noone can control it. Only way, that people react, is important. We are all free thinking and expressing our own thoughts, because it is only way people can live and communicate. 
On another hand is government policity and there fears about changing of people's politition thoughts. There are lots of examples in history about controlling people medium (what people can watch, listen or read). Usually it was unreal to controll all content, that people was taking and artists were always versus it. 
In generall, I think, that people should be free in expressing their own thoughts. I think so, because of people's nature. We must be free in our own thoughts and artists should not be controlled by government. It is our right for freedom. Goverment should only controll our activities (resault of our thinging). Everyone can desagree, with artists' ideas. And it cannot affect people thoughts generally, without people' agreament.
