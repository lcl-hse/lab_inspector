The given graph below presents the percentage of the population aged sixty five and older during the period taken between 1940 and 2040 in Japan, Sweden, and the USA. 
It is clearly seen that the graph shows the differences in population after sixty five years between three chosen countries. The most unsimilar line to others is presented by Japan. It shows a small tall from five to three percent at the beginning and is stable for nearly 25 years. After this point the population of elder people in Japan is surely rising up to ten percent in 2030 and fastly increased to 27 percent in 2040. The two other countries show some similarity in growing up tp 1980, but Sweden elder citizens are 2 percent less than American ones. The tendency is interrupted by a stable percentage of the USA from 1990 to 2020 and its increase. However, Sweden elder population rises from 13 percent to 25 in 2040 with a small pause in between. 
To sum up, the graph presents some similarity in the percentage of elder population in the USA and Sweden and a sharp growth in Japan.
