Sometimes, high school programmes include unpaid community service and some people think that it is a good idea. For example it could be working for a charity or teaching sports to younger children or programm to protect rivers and forests from the pollution. 
Generally it is a good idea. It's a good for a pupils of a high school and for a other people. 
Volunteers are needed everywhere. There are some areas there volunteers help are needed. Teaching young children to make some good things like a sport skills. 
In my opinion, unpaid community service must be a compulsory part of high school programmes. It is a good thing then you can teach somebody or help to our nature. In high classes some children have stress because they are afraid of their pass of last exams. But sometimes this volunteer programmes can take much time. And therefore many children didn't take part in this community services because they are afraid that they will haven't enough time to prepare to their exams. But unpaid community service is ussually good experience and a place for communication. You will fing many friends if you will take place in this services, because there are many people with open soul are volunteers. They didn't work for money, they help to people because they like it. 
In conclusion, unpaid community service have some pluses and some minuses.
