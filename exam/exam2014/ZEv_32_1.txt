The graphs describes travelling abroad from the UK and the same time the amount of visitors of this country between 1979 and 1999 with the information given about the most attractive countries to visit for UK residents according to 1999. 
The first graph shows that during the whole twenty years. From 1979 to 1999, there were more people from the United Kingdom who prefer travelling to another places. Moreover, the number of such people is more than fifty million which almost two times less than the number of overseas residents who would like to visit the UK. The main tendency is that both travels to and from the United Kingdom increased in numbers from 1979 to 1999. 
According to another graph it can be noticed that more than ten million of UK visitors choose for their trips France, which is about one fifth of the all visits abroad. However, there is also a country, which the British prefer Spain. The number of visitors is less but not so small as to USA, Greece and Turkey which number of visitors does not even reach five million. 
All in all, the British want to travel abroad and not to stay at their own homes. For this they mainly choose the Central Europe, France, while the number of visits the UK is still smaller to 1999. It means that the United Kingdom is attractive for travellers from other regions from all over the world but becomes less interesting for its resident.
