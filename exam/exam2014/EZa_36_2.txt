Our life demands by searching happiness and the point of life. Some people say that these are synonims. Every person has his own reasons to be happy but not everyone can achieve it. It is difficult and I will try to explain why. 
Firstly, a person must understand what is happiness for him. And it is not easy as it seems. There are a lot of examples of people who walked around their own happiness and could not catch it. 
Secondly, there are a lot of unhappiness because people are afraid of it. Maybe it happens because of we get used so famous novel characters which show that if you have not any troubles, you always walk with a smile on your face, probably you are a stupid person. Of course nobody can be happy forever, but people must not want to surfer. 
And finally, when a person could catch the idea of what can make him happy, he should keep it and never let it down, fighting for it until the end. It is possible that a person could never reach a goal, get a thing which could make him a happy man. For example, money. The one who sees his happiness in being a very reach man. If he tries really hard he might be happy because of his trying even he is not as reach as he wanted to be. 
In conclusion, I want to say that it is all up to us to be or not to be happy. There are a lot of things confusing and bothering us in our intence to be happy, including our selves. All we need is to follow our intuition and then even the happines is difficult to define, we can find the right way to reach it.
