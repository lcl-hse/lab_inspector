There is a popular people's opinion that the best way to improve health is physical training. However, there are some people who argue that sport training is not enough for our sustainable health. 
On the other hand, it is certainly a profitable way of improving health - physical training. Many people go to the gym or to the dance club or doing swimming course to improve their health. Moreover, every day and every hour we see the examples of healthy life style by sportsmen, by olympic champions who show us that really sport is life, that if we want to choose something we should try again and again. These people inspire us to move forward, to do physical exercises and support our health. 
On the other hand, we watch these olympic sportsmen and see that sport can as cure us, so and harm us. We make implications that there is something else except sport exercise, something that can help us. Often in many magazines we look through different articles and see that a heakthy diet is no less profit to our organism than physical training. Also even "harm food" is useful in some situations. For example, bananas, chocolate, nuts and sweets rise up the mood of a person if he is in depression. So, even such harmful products can have a healthy impact. Furthermore, minerals and vitamins can have a benefitial impact. 
Summing up, it is needless to say that everyone can find the more appropriate way for himself. As for me, I believe that only a combination of different methods alltogether can support a healthy self-feeling of a person.
