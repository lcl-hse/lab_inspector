The graph and the pie chart give some information about using electricity in summer in comparision to in winter, as well as for what reasons. 
To begin with, it is notisible that the typical daily demand for electricity doubles in winter, especially, the consumption is very high at 9 p.m. It is obvious, that in cold days people tend to heating rooms and water and it needs more electricity than usually. 
Also we can see that the lowest demand for electrisity is 7 a.m. On average in summer people's usage of electrisity reaches a pick at 3 p.m.
It is interesting that more than half demand for electricity because of heating. Other needs occupy approximately the same persentage of usage (about 15%).
All in all, on the graph and on the pie chart we can notice that in winter the quantity of units of electrisity using rises. It might happens because of the increasing need of heating so it is the biggest part of that for what people use electrisity.
