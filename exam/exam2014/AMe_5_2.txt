Nowadays, the problem of artist's censorship is very actual. The freedom is important part of artist's lifestayl. First, the essay will analyse artists' freedom, then it will look at the opposite viewpoin and finally, it try to drow some conclusion. 
One people think, that creative people should not have any restrictions. If artist is free, he can make wonderful works of art. He can change word around him. in addition, if he does everything that he wants, it can be usfull because he can create something absolutely new. Is one of the biggest disadvantages of freedom is that the person has not any responsibility and sometime makes a terrible things. It is art garbages and has a bad influence on people. 
Other people belive that goverment should limit artists' ideas. Goverment restriction can form only true art. The good part of art can be chosen and used by people. On the other hand, it can be dangerous for art and crietive people. sometime political situation is the reason of many censorship. The rusult is the artists lies.
Having looked at both sids, I am absolutely desagree with this opinion. The freedom is a very important thing and without it art cannot be true.
