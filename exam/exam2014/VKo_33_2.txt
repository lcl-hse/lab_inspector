The statement about whether or not artists should have a right to express their own ideas in any way they want to is quite debatable. There are people who hold very contradictory arguements on this issue that I am going to discuss below in order to reach and express my own opinion, Up to my opinion, modern artists, of course, should have the freedom to create beautiful works in any way they want to. 
First of all, it is a one of the basic rights of human to express their thoughts and beliefs in any way, and government should be the sentinel of this right, not the enemy. As we live in liberal world, full of rights, that helps induviduals live freedom and happy, a chance to the artists to create anything in anyway should be protected. 
Secondly, this right gives the opportunity to the mankind as to create such beautiful, outstanding work, performances, music that become a cultural, worldwide treasure. For example, the art of Salvador Dali was extraordinary, odd, most of people does not understand it even today, but a right to express his thoughts this way gived us such tromendous works, that everyone accepted. 
To the end, I should admit the importance of freedom to express the ideas, althought, government should protect it, and give it an opportunity for develop.
