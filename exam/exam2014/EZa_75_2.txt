Nowadays there are a lot of talented people. They can express their creativity in different ways. Some people think that the government should control their behaviour, while others are sure that artists should be free in expressing their ideas. This problem is really controversial and there are two different views. 
It is clear that creative people have talent. We are living in free society, so everyone can express his opinion and ideas. Creative people should have freedom. There are some arguments that can support this point of view. Firstly, for most artists expressing their ideas is a way of life. They cannot live without music, pictures and poems. Secondly, they earn money through expressing their own ideas. For example, sell paintings or music. Moreover, artists express their feeling in works of art. Furthermore, they can tell about issues that exist in our society in their works. So, people can understand problems and think of them. 
On the other hand, full freedom can be dangerous for society. Some modern artists spoil buildings with their paintings. Also some pieces of art can be very dangerous for children conscious. For example, films or paintings that illustrate erotic actions and naked people. So it is logically to restrict some ways of expression ideas. 
These arguments might seem persuasive, but it is really important to take into account that people should be free to express their ideas. It can bring in our life creative and fresh views and ways of solving problems. 
To sum up, artists should be given freedom. Government cannot rrestrict their wish to create wonderful and interesting pieces of art. Everyone should be free.
