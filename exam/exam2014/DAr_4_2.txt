Nowadays, the question about public health is really communicated. There are two points of view: some people believe, that the best method to improve the health of nation is by increasing the number of sport facilities. Others consider that there are more effective ways. Firstly, I want to think about the second point of view. Actually, big quantity of sport facilities like football pitches, places for people who want run or ride a bike and so on gives an opportunities to citizens for increasing health. And this system works for part of population which is ready to practise short. From the other hand, somebody believes that there are more effective ways. For instance, it can be the social advertisement which shows that smoking an alcohol do harm to our health; or some other advetisement for health way of life. It can help for people,and also it predict bad habits of teenagers. By the way, prediction of bad habits is not the health way of life. In my opinion, the advertisement and increasing of sport facilities must work together and it is the best method to omprove public health. If population will understand that sport in necessary for their health, and wiil start practise football or fitness, the level of public health will soar. Now, we have sport facilities, but do not see result: this system works for people who want and who is ready to do something with himself. The goal of government is do the sport popular between everybody. To sum up, I want to say that two opinions has advantages and disadvantages, that is why we must realize perfect system which will improve national health by force of every effective methodes.
