Nowadays it is often believed that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students for each subject. In my opinion, there are special subjects for men and women, so I am disagree with the statement. 
First of all, there are special universities based on country's army, so there will be more male students than female, that is why universities cannot accept equal numbers of them on all subjects, even if in such girls study chorgover, there are different are different physical subjects and trainings which are too difficult for women's health and physical abilities. Overall, there is no need to organise the same numbers of male and female students for universities. 
In addition, there are special male professions, for example, pilots, builders, capitans, which are extremely difficult and nervious, and which are impossible to do for women. Furthermore, there are also special female work, which men are not able to do, as nurses or teachers in kindergarten and so on, that is why in this case there is no need for men to listen courses about children phsycology, and for universities - to accept equal numbers of male and female students. 
Consequently, I see no efficient opportunities after organising such studying proccess, and I am disagree with the statement given. Students should have their own choice which subjects to learn, as universities should decide themselves how to organise subjects and number of people on them. Nowadays everyone is free to choose and achieve what he wants and needs.
