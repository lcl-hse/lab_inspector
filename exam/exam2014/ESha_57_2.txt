It is commonly belived that people will be healthier if governments open more sports centres and sports grounds. However, there is an opposite point of view. Those who argued that sport facilities are worthless say that there are other ways to increase public health I do believe that the first statement is true and the more sport activities are required the healthier nation will be. 
The first arguement to prove that the increasing of public health depends on sports facilities is that if there are plenty of different sport places it will be more affordable for people with lower budgets to do sport not only by themselves, nut also by their children. It seems to be an issue, because nowadays, for example in Russia it is affordable only for rich people. It is obvious that without the ability for youth to be healt there is no chance for improving public health. 
However, there is another point of view, which is opposite to mine. Some people argue that increasing the quantity of clinics or medical centres will be a better decision. As for me there is enough of those stuff, but if they are not doing their best. It would be better to open new swimming pools, tracks and ground on the free spaces, and in the same time, qualify those medical care that we already have. 
Taking everything into consideration, the advantages overweigh its drawbacks, so it is worth opening them, than to do some other mesures.
