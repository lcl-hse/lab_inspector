Nowadays, there is a discuss regarding the effect of exacerbating number of sports centres on health of the nation. However there is an opposite point of view, which states that this rise in amount of sport facilities has a minimal impact on public health and there are a lot of different things to do and improve. 
On the one hand, the huge amount of such places as gyms, swimming pools in city or town is great opportunity to improve level of health because people do not have to go outskirts or to the edge of the city to workout. Moreover, the large amount of sport centres in cities are leading to competition among companies. Consequently, it has a tremendous effect on prices of the contracts in such centres. 
On the other hand, if people do not want to make exercises or swim, they will not by any membership contracts in a gym or pool. In other words, people do not have motivation to working out. Henceforth, the improving access to sports clubs do not affect on public level or health. 
I am inclined to believe that the amount of sports facilities is a great opportunity to start going to gym or pool, because people do not have to spend too much time to travel to these centers. In addition, the remaining that keeping our body fit is fashion nowadays by huge number of sport clubs is the amazing way to rise the level of national health, no matter that others saying.
