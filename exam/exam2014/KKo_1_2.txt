Nowadays there is a heated discussion concerning the impact of the quantity of sport centers on the well-being of population. It is believed that a big amount of these facilities will increase the rate of healthy people while some people claim that the influence of such tools is not so huge. 
From the first point of view, if there will be more pools and sport centers in towns, so people will spend more time on active way of life. Thus, the level of public health will go up. Moreover, physical exercises are the best solution for any illness. When we move, we make our organism working better, so that it will provoke improvement of all organs. 
On the other hand, people believe that sport facilities will not encourage to not take pills or get off from harmful habits. Instead, the government should push the people to take sport and stop sedentary way of life. What is more, there are enough facilities for persons who want to use them. For example, for those people who like jogging there are parks and forests. The implementation of new tools will not change their preferences and they will continue to do the same, but in the different place. 
In my opinion, there is no base to say that growing of sport facilities will change health rate of society a lot. As far as I am concerned it would be better to invent psychological methods to explain to people drawbacks of life without sport and with harmful patterns.
