Some people believe artists should be free to express their creativity whereas some would say that the government should take cautions to restrain them. 
It is widely known that the modern world with its new technologies has created new vision of art. Nowadays, people think differently than they did some years age. That is the reason of appearing various art works which are not appealing for most people. 
An artist without freedom is said not to be able to create anything. Artist should have a right to express his own identity in his works. Art should not be framed, otherwise there is a possibility that a talented person couldn't produce a masterpiece, which would mean a great loose for the society, for the culture. 
In contrast, there is an opinion that modern artists should be restrained, because some of them just do not have a talent, others are not too much expressive and can influence badly on peoples nervous system. There should be some rules which they need to follow, so that they will not cause any damage. 
To sum up, freedom should be given to artists, so they can impress us with new and extraordinary pieces of work. However they should have some moral ethics and principles not to damage anyone.
