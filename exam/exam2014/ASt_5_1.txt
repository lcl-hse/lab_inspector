The chart illustrates the variation of types of qualification that Australian men and women received after their graduation from school. The data were collected in 1999. 
On the whole, the number of men with any kind of qualification differs significantly from that of women. It makes up the total of almost 100% of males that posses skilled vocational diploma compared to just 10% of females with the same diploma. The percentage of men-owners of postgraduate diploma is around 2,5 times bigger and the proportion of male-owners of master's degree is 1,5 times bigger than women with the same qualifications respectively. The situation with undergraduate diploma and bachelor's degree showed a different picture. There is a dramatic increase in the number of women with undergraduate diploma at 75% with less sharp decrease of men in this category with the percentage stands at 40%. Although the difference in proportion of males and females who acquired bachelor's degree is not so significant. 
Overall, the percentage of men and women with the same type of post-school qualification fluctuated dramatically. Still, men are more likely to receive an educational degree and University diploma than women.
