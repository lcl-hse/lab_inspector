Nowadays, when we live in the modern world, when people have a quick temp of life, they work for major part of their life and man and woman do not have enough time for rest and also for eating healthy home foods. As a result, we have problems with our healthy. Some people think that the best way for improving health of society is by increasing the number of sport facilities that will give opportunities to us to improve health. But another part of the society say that it is an idea will not effectively and that there are other measure that required. 
As for me, I think that increasing sport facilities is not a good idea because if people do not have enough time for it he will not do sport and when government will build more gyms. What is more, some part of population do not do sport for their condion of health. Moreover, it is not enough effective for society since people are not motivate in improving their health. What is more, if people do not understand that if need for their health, that it is usefull and it helps to live for long time they do not want to do sports. 
But other people believe that it's way of improving health effective for society for people can do sport if they have more sport facilities. Besides, when people see that someone start to do sport, they become to repeate and get incentives for this. 
In conclusion, I should say, that if people do not want to do something in our case, do sport, different facilities do not help to improve public health. Moreover should create some programme that will motivate society.
