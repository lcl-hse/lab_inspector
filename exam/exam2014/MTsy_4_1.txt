The chart below shows the information about the population in Yemen and Italy. 
As we can see, in the year of 2000 in Yemen there were more than a half of population, aged from 0 to 14. So, the population of young people was much more in Yemen, than in Italy. It was only 14.3% in Italy in 2000. But, the workable population (aged 15-59) was bigger in Italy, than in Yemen (61,6% contra 46,3%). And, finally, Yemen's population is more younger, than Italy's one. There were only 3,6% of people aged 60 years in Yemen, and 24,1% in Italy. 
It is predicted, that it is going to be a reduce of the population aged 0-14 both in Yemen and Italy (from 50,1% to 37% and from 14,3% to 15.5%). But, we can see a rapid growth in population aged 15-59 in Yemen, and the same increase in population aged 60 years in Italy. So, both countries will become "older". It is also going to be a reduce of population aged 0-14 in Yemen, but Yemen's population will be younger, than Italy's one.
