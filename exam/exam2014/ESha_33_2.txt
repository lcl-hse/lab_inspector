Some people believe that creating more sport facilities leads to improving public health. However, others do not believe that it is effeictive and they say that other measures are required. I agree with the second opinion. 
The first thing that important to mention is that increasing the number of sport facilities really does create more opportunities to people. It is really hard to do sports if there are no sport centres and play grounds. Despite this fact, many people just do not use the sport facilities that they have in their cities. It doesn't really matter how many sport centeres there are in a city, there are always will be only few people using the opportunity to do sports. So, creating more sort facilities would not have a big effect on public health. 
I think that government can improve public health by promoting sport to kids. It is important to show them that sport not only saves their health but also makes their muscles grow. PE teachers should explain pupils how a human body works and what materials (food) it needs to work well. Also, government should start doing more sport competitions with attractive prizes. I always wanted to win a prize when I was a kid. The last, but not the least way to improve public health is to spend more money on medical centeres and create some TV commercials, which will show the people the harm of alcohol, tobacco and other drugs. 
In conclusion it is important to say that public health improovement is only possible if a government does a whole lot of things, such as sport propaganda, anti-drug propaganda and development of medical care.
