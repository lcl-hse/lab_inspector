The graph and the chart demonstrate how people use electricity in England. The graph reflects this usage in dependence on time of the day and the year. The pie chart shows it according to the purposes. 
According to the graph the amount of electricity spent by an average English household in winter is twice as high as in summer and it is between 30000 and 40000 units of electricity. In winter this usage grows from midnight to 3 a.m. and than it falls until 8 a.m. as well as in summer. In both seasons there is a sharp rise between 9 and 15 hours in the use of electricity and until 10 p.m. when it rockets again it remains stable. The only difference is there is a considerable shortage in use of electricity after the first growth in summer. 
The pie chart shows that the most part of electricity is (52,5%) used to heat rooms and water. The amount of electricity, spent on ovens, kettles, and washing machines is three times as low as for heating. Lightning, TV and radio take only 15% of all electricity usage as well as vacuum cleaners, food mixers and electric tools. 
To put it in a nutshell, the graphs show that the most part of electricity in English houses is used in winter and for heating. When the amount of electricity spent for other purposes and in summer is twice lower.
