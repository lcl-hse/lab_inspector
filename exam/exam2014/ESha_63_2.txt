Nowadays, there are a lot of different ills and most of them connect with stess. That's way public health become worse and worse. What should be done to improve public health? What kind of measures are required for this goal? 
Some people suggest to increase the number of sport facilities. I don't sure that it will be have great utility. Nowadays there are a lot of fitness and sport centres, but the quantity of people, whose attempt them not to high as thought. It can be cause of high price for aboniment in this centres. That is why increasing the number of facilities is not best deccion. 
One of the ways to solve this problem is to give people more opportunities for good rest. For example, to make prices on different sports centres lower and people could be able to allow themselves this kind of rest. Besides, emploeers can motivate people to be more carefull and keep fit by different perks. Organisations can make various competition which will help relax and to do the best for team sprint. 
However, to be health is the decision of each other. Nobody not can make you to cae about your health if you do not want it. 
Government can only care about quality of products and foods and provides as opportunities to keep our health. 
All things considered, I strongly believe that every person should think about their health byself. If there are not enough sport facilities, person who want to be health, finals another ways for this goal. That is way, I'm sure that increasing the number of sports facilities is not solution of this problem.
