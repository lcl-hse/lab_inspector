Nowadays it is thought by lots of people that happiness plays a really great role in our everyday life. But here come rather philosophical questions: What do you mean saying "happiness"? How can you come to a happy life? 
As far as myself is concerned I can say that I fully support that point of view, because I think that the happiness is the basis of your life. If you are happy, you can easily reach any goals you want. 
To my mind happiness is something which makes your heart beats, something which makes your life colourful. I remember the story of Russian aviator Alex Meresev, whose happiness was rather huge and could fly far in the sky. But one black day he lost his legs in a crash and doctors said that he would never fly again. As I have already said Mr. Meresev couldn't live without flying, he trained alot¬ and at last he learned how to fly without legs. 
But not everyone think that flying is happiness. That is why it is rather hard to define, to read 'what is it' just taking a dictionary. 
In my opinion if you want to achieve happiness, you call yourself 'happy', you should, firstly, tell yourself what is happiness for you. 
Secondly, you should work and work to achieve your happiness. Happiness here is like a dream, but you can get it, it is not the same with 'riding a unicorn'. 
My mother had a dream. She wanted to live with a family in Moscow. She came to Moscow, studied hard in university, work hard as an economist, and now she can call herself happy, she realized her dream, she got her happiness. 
In conclusion it should be said that you can make your life happy, you can live in happiness. You just need to work and believe in your own dream.
