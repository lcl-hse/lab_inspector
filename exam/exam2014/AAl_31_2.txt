It can be suggested that it is necessary to accept equal amount girls and boys in every subject in the Universities. However, this statement has some advantages and disadvantages. Nowadays, there is no doubt that disadvantages of this statement are less valuable than proccess. 
To begin with the point about discrimination male and female students in Universitet, if they should study every subject in equal numbers. Probably, some of them do not want to study some subject, for example, girls do not prefer physical culture, at the same time, boys are keen on sport more than literature. As a result, there are some problems. One more of the main argument is that studing together male and female students can help to socialized them. Besides, it can be seen from the life, that men are good at one aspects and women are the best in other questions. They can help to each other to know something significant and usufull, because nobody knows all in this life. However, if was equal amount of male and female students, it can easy to work in pare. Unfortunatelly, not all students are prefer to work such way. Usually it is more pleasant for girls to communicate with the same category, because they have the same hobbies. More than that, usually male and female can embrassed each other and it also can a problem, if there are not the same numbers of men and women. 
To sum up, it can be concluded, that the discrimination to all students in groups to the equal amount can break their writs. However, there are more advantages of this and it is possible to create some programms in Universities.
