Nowadays in developening countryes creative people try to express their own relationship to important problems in wolrd by words, pictures, music and films. Howether, government control this. I believe, that they should to re-strictions some bad and harmful ideas. 
One cause why I disagree, It that creative artists sometimes do not think which effect may be do their ideas on society. It can be bad effect on many people. For example, in the modern songs have ideas, that the luxary life it is the best way to spend time. Songers sing, that money and expensive cars and house more important than love, friends, children. 
I think that artist may be express their own ideas and some times it is useful for people because it illustrate important society problems, but it is should be in the good format and consist of normal things.
