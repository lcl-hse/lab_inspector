These two charts show us the features of studying process. 
In the first chart we can see the correlations between age of students and their purpouses for studying. It is clearly demonstrated that amount of people who enter the university for career reasons much bigger in the age of 40 - 49 than over the age of 49. Moreover it is an interesting fact that persent of people of age between 40 and 49 equally motivated in studying both career and interest. 
The second graph reflects the situation of employment. According to this informatin it could be said that people between under 26 and 29 and over the age of 49 are more supported by the employers. At the same time employees between 30 and 49 are not so popular among the employers. 
To sum it up, the situation with education shown on these charts is quiet unexpected in some cases.
