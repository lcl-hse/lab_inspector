Nowadays there are a lot of subjects in universities, about which people say that they are only for men or only for women. For example, engineering us a "male" subject. Some people think universities should make all subjects equal by studying equal numbers of male and female students. In my opinion, this is not effective way to teach students. 
Firstly, there are always professions, which are "male" and "female". If universities teach only equal numbers of male and female students, these people will get the job in equal quantity: there will be men, who work in library, in kindergardens and women, who work in sports centre, in car production. In my opinion, it will be a mess. Men and women should work on suitable jobs. 
Furthermore, people have a habitat that often in one group there is different quantity of men and women. It is good from psyhological point of view: when the quantity of men is higher than the quantity of women, there is a kind of war beetween women for men: every wants to be paid all attention on her. The nature made these interesting threat of character in us. 
Also, when woman wants to study something "male", it will be difficult to do by herself. That is why men of her university's group will help her. It makes friendship stronger. It is not a secret that male group is more pleasant than group of women because of women's treats of character. 
All in all, in my opinion, it is important to save unequal numbers of men and women in university. As we can see, it is neccesary not only because of studying process, and also for living experience of every student.
