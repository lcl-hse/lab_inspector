The line graph shows information about the number of visits of UK residents in foreign countries and the number of visits in UK made by foreigners. The bar chart provides information about the most popular foreign destinations among people who live in the UK. 
To start with, at the very beginning of the illustrated period in 1979 the numbers of visits made by both UK residents and foreigners were very much similar and stayed at the point of about 10 million cases. Then just these figured grew slightly and in approximately seven years reached the points of 20 millions and near 12 millions respectively. After that there was a significant growth in the number of visits abroad by UK residents and by the end of the shown period in 1999 this figure stayed at the point of more than 50 millions visits. The growth of the number of visits to the UK by overseas residents was not so dramatic and reached the point of nearly 30 million visits. 
The bar chart shows that in 1999 the most popular UK residents went to was France. This country was visited by more than 10 million people from the UK. The second most popular country was Spain with nearly 10 million UK visitors. USA, Greece and Turkey were the least popular countries for travellers from the UK. 
To sum up, between 1979 and 1999 the number of both UK residents who travelled abroad and foreigners who went to the UK saw a certain increase and in 1999 among all countries UK residents preferred France and Spain the most.
