There is two pieces of information. One showed in graph, another showed in pie chart. First piece of information describes the demand for electricity in England during typical days in winter and summer. Second show how electricity is used in an average English home. 
The graph shows that in winter at 10 o'clock in the evening is a highest point of using electricity more then 40,000 units. In the period from 6 o'clock in the morning to 9 o'clock in the morning people do not use electricity much. So English people do not like to get up in warm rooms. 
In summertime situation is littile bit the same but peack of using Electricity is between 12 and 15. People in summertime do not use heating at night, that's why in 12 o'clock in the night units of electricity decreased.
