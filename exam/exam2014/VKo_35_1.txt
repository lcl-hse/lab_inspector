The chart illustrates the different levels of post-school qualifications in Australia according to gender in 1999. 
It is clear from the graph that in such post-school qualifications as Skilled vocational diploma, Postgraduate diploma and Master's degree can be found that the percentage of males is higher than the percentage of females. As for the other two qualifications, they have the opposite tendency: in such qualifications as Undergraduate diploma and Bachelor's degree the proportion of women is higher than the proportion of men. The biggest difference between women and men who held the post-school qualifications can be seen in skilled vocational diploma: it accounts for around 90 percent of men and just for around 10 percent of women. The graph shows that practically the same proportion of males and females can be found in Bachelor's degree: about 53 percent of females and about 47 percent of males.
