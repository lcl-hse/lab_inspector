The table represents numbers of people in the UK working in different spheres. People are divided into groups by age. Numbers are compared between the years 1998 and 2006. 
The greatest changes are seen in the sphere of technology, where the numbers soared from 1998 to 2006 throughout all the age categories. The least change has happened to the sphere of education where the numbers stayed almost the same. 
The most striking difference can be spotted between the number of people aged from 18 to 25 occupied in the sphere of technology from 1998 to 2006. In the building sphere a drop can be seen in all the age categories. We can't see any tendency in the hotel and catering sphere as its changes are chaotic and mostly irrelevant.
