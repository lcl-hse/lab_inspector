The chart illustrates how much time people in the UK spend by telephone calls from 1995-2002. These telephone calls divided into three categories. 
Local calls on the fixed line is the most popular in the UK. And for example, in 1999 people spend 90 billions minutes by the local calls. National and international calls around half from local calls in 1998. But minutes of these calls slightly increased from 1995 to 2002. In 1995 mobiles weren't so popular and therefore people in the UK spend around 4 billion minutes of telephone calls per year. But then in 2000 the mobiles calls became more popular and minutes of calls steply increased. And in 2002 local calls on the fixed lines became less popular than in 1999. But mobile calls and national and international calls spend more time than early.
