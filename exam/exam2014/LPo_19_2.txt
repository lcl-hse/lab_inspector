Nowadays the proportion of males and females among students depends on different factors, such as the faculty, the location, the prestige of the university, etc. Because of this some people are sure that university should accept the equal number of girls and boys among its abiturients while in my opinion, such kind of system is useless. 
First of all, some works demand only males or females. For example, to be a driver in subway it is necessary to be a man while women are considerably not able to do this work. In this case, if the subway college would have the opportunity to study females, they will not be able to find any work after graduating. 
Secondly, even if the university will accept equal proportion of males and females, some students will fail exams not reached the end of study, and the proportion will be ruined. I find the conception not very good. 
Besides, it is clear that the majority of people are women and the proportion of students cannot be provided due to this factor. 
Taking everything into account, I would like to notice that for me such system of acception students has a lot of disadvanteges (among them "male proffessions" or "female professions" that exclude needs in both genders). I think, it should not be done.
