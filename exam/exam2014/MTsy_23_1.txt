The picture below shows the structure of populations in Yemen and Italy divided by age. 
The main part of general population in Yemen in 2000 consisted of children aged from 0 to 14, when a bit less than a half of the whole population in the same year was presented by people aged from 15 to 59. Surprisingly, only 3,6% of the whole population were elderly people (who are older than 60). The projection for 2050 illustrates slight changes in population age mix: the number of children under 14 years old will cut to 37%, when more than a half of all people in Yemen will be aged from 15 to 59. 
In 2000 the largest part of the population in Italy consisted of people aged from 15 to 59. When the proportion of children under 14 years old and elderly people was about 1:2. The projection for 2050 suggests the rise of the part of elderly people, that will be taking 42,3% of the whole population, and a significant decrease of middle-aged people. The diagram also shows, that the amount of people aged from 0 to 14 will fall slightly. 
Both the pie charts show a tendency of both populations getting older, while the amount of children is steadily getting down.
