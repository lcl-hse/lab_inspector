There is a tendency to have a year-off by young people after finishing high school. But is it undoubtedly positive? 
One argument is favour of this issue is that children can travel for a year and get acquainted with different cultures. For example, when they go abroad they can easily meet different people and study their customes and traditionals. And also children can broaden their outlook and knowledge. Moreover, having a gap year they can gain experience at work, which can help to be relevant on the labour of market, because the employers support only people who have skills, know ledge and also the experience in the sphere. Furthermore, when child has a year between finishing high school and starting university studies he or she can make a own choice what he or she want in the future career. That is why a year-off is very useful. 
However, such experience can have a negative influence on children's mind. For instance, some children prefer not to work and travel, they want only go for a walk with their friends, relax and have leasure time. So, during some time children become so lazy to have a career or have some future plans. In addition to this, having a gap year children can stop their development and stuck in the routine, so in this case their university study can help to prevent this situation. 
To take all the abovementioned into consideration, there are two ways which young people can choose. One the one hand, it is a great opportunity to have a year-off, as you can decide what exactly you want in the future, but on the other hand, you can stop your education and cannot to resist some temtations.
