Nowadays it becomes possible for students to have a gap-year before going to university, which they can spend travelling or having a working experience. In some countries such an opportunity is highly welcomed, many advantages are thought to be found, from some people's point of view. As I see it, the argument is flawed. 
It is believed that a gap-year is a chance for students to think once again what career to choose. Especially helpful would be a working experience before applying to a university, so youngsters can see what they are good at and what preferences they have. Moreover the become more mature while working and more prepared for university life. Apart from this, teenagers can travel for a year, see the world, practice their communicative skills and obviously, relax before a hard year in a university and a beginning of their new adult life. An experience of having a gap-year, is popular in the USA. 
However, I doubt theese ideas to be as reasonable as they tend to be. Firstly, if a person decides to work before applying to a university they should be aware of losing interest in having further education for the reasons of being involved in their career plans. Secondly, they may lose many of their skills, an ability to learn. As for the travelling, if students choose to take this opportunity, they have a risk to drop an idea of a higher education for the reasons of seeming boring comparing to travelling. Also, such a trip will cost much, many students can't even afford this luxerious experience. 
In conclusion, the disadvantages of having a gap-year for students far outweigh the advantages for the reasons mentioned above.
