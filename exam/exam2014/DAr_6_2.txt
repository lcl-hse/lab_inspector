Health problems has always been an issue in out 21st century. Governments have been trying to find solution to that problem for years. One of the ways is to increase the number of sport facilities. Let's consider some pros and cons of the measure. First of all I'll cover the positive aspect. The more sport facilities available - the more likely people are to go in for sports, that is now it is supposed to work. Of course we can't deny the positive impact of physical activity on our health. Nevertheless, the key word in that scheme is "likely". Going in for sports requires a strong will and a lot of effort. A person, who have never done any sports doubtfully might be motivated only by a new sport center by his house. Consequently the growing number of sport facilities likely will not affect his health condition. Secondly, 4 main determinants of our health conditions (environment, genetics, food). In order to improve your health you have to use complex method. Of course we can't determine our genetics, and it is hard to improve ecological situation, but undoubtfully we can monitor what we consume. As people say, one apple a day keeps a doctor away. Only in this case when we try to have a healthier lifestyle in different spheres the result will be seen. In my opinion, we can't improve health situation in our country only by increasing the number of sport facilities. Complex method should be used.
