To be honest, I don't really know about unpaid community service, maybe, because my parents solve all problems with money or, maybe, because I live in other country, but I'm sure, that this problem is very important in some countries or cities and people should solve it. 
Let's start from charity. Well, this is very hard problem to solve, because in our world there would always be persons who have some deiseses or genetical malfunction, so they would need our help or our money. Let's speak about ways of earning of money. A lot of people just take pictures with their "problem" and sit on the floor and ask for money. I think, that the exposion in museum, when you buy ticket and money from each one will go to charity bills, is a great way to earn money for charity. 
I agree that some schools should have time community service because, for example, when you teach little boy how to play football you learn some positive characteristic such as: how to be a leader, how to work in team, how to communicate with unknown people, and it is very useful type of character in your future. 
On one hand it is very good to improve your skills to learn something now, to become more social, but on other hand someone may don't like to do such work, other one would rather ride a bicycle than work for charity.
