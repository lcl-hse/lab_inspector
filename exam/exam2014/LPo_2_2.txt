Nowadays, there is a common tendency of accepting unequal numbers of men and women in various subjects at universities. Some people think that this situation is normal and there is nothing needed to be done about that. Other people disagree with this opinion. So, there are two different beliefs on this statement. 
On the one hand, male and female students should have fair opportunities of getting knowledge they need. Every subject should be available for any hardworking student. It is true that both genders have their strong sides at particular fields of education and there mustn't be any barriers for entering the interesting sphere for a man or a woman. 
On the other hand, some people suppose that there are some subjects where men are more likely to be successfull than women. For instance, the history gives us a lot of examples of man being talented in math subjects such as physics. Historically, woman were always better at house-keeping or cooking. They claim that woman in science is quite a modern trend. Personally, I don't agree with this point of view. 
To sum up, I would say that everyone should have equal chances of getting education. No matter what happened in the past there should be a fair opportunity for one who wants to study to be able to choose the branch they want to learn about. I agree that men and women have different talents and skills but there also should be a space for someone who has non-standard fields of interest. The modern system of education should be based on the principles of equality for both genders.
