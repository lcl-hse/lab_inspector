Nowadays there are a lot of discussions about the problems wit student's behaviour in schools. I an going to express my own opinion in this issue by thinking about the causes of these problems and suggesting sollutions of it. 
As far as I am concerned, problems with student behaviour appear when they do not have enough control. Sometimes, parents and teachers allow pupils to do a lot of things. When they have much freedom they believe they are look like adults. When they feel so they want to do all they dream about. If parents and relatives do not care enough about their children at home it can lead to their bad behaviour out of home. In some cases, this behaviour can be explained by bad relationships between teachers and parents with pupils. They become angry and rude when they feel annoyed. 
We can find this problem very actual. It is a great debt for adults to suggest sollutions and make decisions to solve it. I think that they should be careful with pupils. For example, teachers in schools should be more attentive with them. When they cry to pupils they can start hate them and may make a trouble for them. As for parents, they ought to protect their children when they are little and young. They must to grow them as good men, but sometimes they should allow them more things as usual. 
To conclude, it should be said that bad student's behaviour is serious problem and we have to find different solutions if we care about children.
