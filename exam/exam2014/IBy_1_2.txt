The recent studies show that the natural traits are more influential on ourselves and our improvement in education, sport and etc., than what we can learn from life, in other words, than our experience. In this essay I will try to discuss both sides of view, givining my personal opinion. 
To begin with, the "nature vs. nurture" problem is really comprehensive and it was stimulating the minds of all our kinds from the ancient history. 
It seems that the nature is most influential only in first years of our being, having less and less in further years. We ho to school, than to the university and sometimes it needs more than just good characteristics we are born with, but confidence and a lot of hard work to perform well.
Secondly, there are a lot of examples of people with dramatically high IQ, who hadn't succeseded in life. There are huge variety of factors: parental raising, education level, country you are live in. 
Otherwise, take a look at the professional sport, particulary, at the runners: most of them are africans. Scientists say that they muscles work, which gives them chance to perform better. Such instances are the best way to indicate the win of nature side. 
In my own opinion, it really differs. There are types of occupations where the natural traits could play the major role, but I also want to believe that there is something about nature or nurture: it is about the connection and interaction of both factors to who we are. 
To conclude with, there are 2 arguments for nurture, which connected with empirical observations and I against nurture, dedicated to the difference in performance of difference race in running.
