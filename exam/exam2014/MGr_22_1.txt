The aforementioned line graph compares the daily consumption of electricity in England in two different seasons: winter and summer. At the same time, the aforementioned pie chart provides information about how electricity is consumed in a typical English home.
It is visibly that the highest demand for electricity appears: during the coldest months of the year. So, relative to the consumption of electricity in summer, the winter consumption is double-higher. Furthermore, in winter the curve gradually increases to reach 40000 units of electricity by 3 o'clock in the morning. This is followed by gradual decline to the lowest point of 30000 units at 9 o'clock. 
Speaking about summer time, the consumption of electricity gradually decrease to reach its lowest point around 9 o'clock of a bit more than 10000 units. A gentle increase is noticed to reach its peak of 20000. After this, it stays constant (15000 units) between 3 o'clock and 10 o'clock at night. 
The pie chart shows 52,5% of electricity is used for heating rooms and water. I think, this is mostly common in winter. Nonetheless, 17,5% is consumed for ovens, kettles and washing machines. The same 15% of electricity is used for both lighting, TV radio and vacuum cleaners, food mixers, electronic tools. 
To crown it all, the electricity demand of an average English household hits its peak at late hours on winter days and this mentioned demand is mainly formed by the need to heat rooms and water.
