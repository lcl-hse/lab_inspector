Nowadays there are lots of argues on whether the number of men and women in universities should be equal. So can universities accept equal proportion of people of both genders in every subject? I believe it can't and there are several reasons for such opinion. 
First of all, all people cannot have the same skills. It is widely known that the majority of boys has better and dipper skills in Mathematics than girls. So, it is obvious that universities cannot accept the equal number of boys and girls in some technical subjects. Also, not many boys are interested in Arts, Literature or Design, that is why it is impossible to have equal proportion of people of both genders in these subjects. 
Secondly, women are not able to study some subjects as it is dangerous or too difficult for them. For example, universities cannot accept girls to study some specific kinds of surgery as very hard equipment is used there. What is more, some military universities do not accept women because men and women have different mental and psychological skills. It can be really hard or even impossible for young women to fight against other people with weapons. 
On the other hand, it could be said that in the 21st century there should not be differentiation between genders and universities should accept equal proportion of boys and girls for each subject. Modern young women are strong and smart enough to enter a military or technical university. 
All in all, I strongly believe that it is not possible to have 50:50 proportion of men and women in all kinds of universities. The most important thing for universities to have students that have appropriate skills in a subject and are interested in it whichever gender these students are.
