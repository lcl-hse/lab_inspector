Nowadays the art is very popular. Many young and old persons create beutiful things every day. And it is remarkable. But sometimes those people forget about the rules. 
Creative artists make new ideas and they want to have the freedom. They want to go where they want. They have the law to think in own way. Of course they could draw what they want and create the music. 
However, sometimes they forget about people around them and about moral principals. Creative people should not evade responsibility. Laws has to extend on all people. I disagree, that if the creative person commits a crime, he can avoid punishment. In my opinion artists are ordinary people, like all women and men around us. 
In conclusion, I think that creative artists should do everything if they do not break the government's restrictions and laws. They must create our life and make better. Their creativity has to bear mood and emotions. They are often strange people, but they have to be able to control their actions when they live in society.
