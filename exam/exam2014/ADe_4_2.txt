Nowadays a person can hardly be called an educated without knowing at least one foreign language. But what is the perfect time to start learning it? Experts argue whether we should begin at primary or secondary school, although leaning towards the earliest variant. 
To begin with, it is a well known fact that young children have a better capacity for learning. Their memory is faster, their imagination is more picturesque and the world is their oyster. So, primary school may be the perfect time to learn as much as possible. 
Still others may advocate that kids should be allowed to have a normal childhood. Who are we to make them spend all precious days with books, studing hard? It is also not profitable for their health, for instance, an eyesight. 
However, I consider heath reasons to be irrelevant to this matter. For example, I used to study English in the kindergarden. But it involved mainly playing with toys and naming them, memorising cards and watching primitive cartoons. I believe there can be no harm in that. Education for kids is a lot different and should be as entertaining as possible. This way a child will take more interest in learing and will gain both more pleasure and profit. Moreover, there are a lot of difficult subjects starting in the secondary school. It is easy for a pupil to become overwhelmed with new information. 
To sum up, it is never too early or too late to learn. Children are open-minded and clever, so even a primary school is a good time to begin learning a foreign language if it is done in a right way.
