The theme of people's gens is very popular nowadays. It is often rised and widely discussed in different sources of mass media. So how personal characteristics influence on us and can we strugle genetic to be who we want to be. 
On the one hand, I'm totally agree with the sciencetists, because human takes his treats of character from the structure of DNA code wchich he is given by his mother and father. On the other hand, if you want to change, yourself you will make it real by changing all around yourself: friends, interests, habitation, work and some time it will change you. But for me, it is more interesting to find the true characteristics of people, because there are so many beautiful variations of it. 
To sum everything up, I must admit that the solution to the problem is a mixed blessing. Considering all arguments for the biological human's evolution. My point of view seems to be the same with topic above.
