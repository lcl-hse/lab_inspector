The table shows some figures about the metro systems in 6 megalopolices all over the world. 
The oldest underground railway system was opened in 1863 in London and the newest one is located in Los Angeles and was opened in 2001, more than a century after London underground opening. 
It is obvious that the oldest metro system is the oldest metro system is the more kilometres of route it has. So the longest underground systems are in London and Paris (394 and 199 kilometres respectively), and the shortest ones are in Los Angeles and Kyoto (28 and 11 kilometres respectively). 
As for the number of passengers per year, the leading metro system is in Tokyo (1927 millions), and the least number of passangers per year is in Kyoto (only 45 millions), and it is clear that the figures difference is significant (more than 40 times). 
To sum up, the oldest subway is in London, the newest one in Los Angeles, the longest underground railway system is in London and the shortest one in Kyoto, the most passengers per year use Tokyo subway, and the least passengers use Kyoto underground.
