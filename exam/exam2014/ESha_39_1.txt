The charts provide information about proportions of the ages of populations of Italy and Yemen in 2000 and predictions for 2050. What catches the eye is that the percentages for the countries are very different and great changes are expected to happen by the 2050. 
In Yemen the number of people over 60 is extremely low but probably will rise by 2050 (from 3,6% to 5,7%). In 2000 half of the population consisted of children under 14. Over the 50 years the growth of the middle group (ages 15 to 59) is expected, so that children will occupy only 37%. 
On the contrary in Italy decrease in middle-age people will occure. While in 2000 over 60% of population belonged to this category and one quarter of Italians were over 60, by 2050 11,5% will be younger than 14 and the rest will be split in halves. 
All in all Yemen is charactirised by the high percentage of young people while Italian population is rather old.
