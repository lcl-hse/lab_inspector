In the recent century people became more lazy and couch-potato because of industrialisation of world economy. The consequence of these behavior is unhealthy body. How individuals try to solve this type of problem. Some people offer to provide individuals with new sport facilities and raise its quantity. Opposite opinion belive that such way can't lead to significant improvment of public health and society should find another approches. 
Firstly, increasing the quantity of sport facilities make sport and activity more attractive for people. Sometimes person can't to go to the gyms or start running because of he just have not any chance. May be individual lives far away from good sport club or hasn't stadium in the district where he lives. 
Secondly, not enough to build sport club or gyms and think that people will come soon. Some individuals need to motivate. It may be done by advertising campeign of health life style. In addition government can make the national sport. For example residents of Norway extremely love skiing and can't imagine their life without it. 
Thirdly, society should watch on young generation. In many times people can't allow themself to enter their child to sport club because of big payment. 
To sum up even though governement start to build a lot of sports facilities such as sport clubs, stadiums and gym. It doesn't mean that individuals will think about health and become active. Of course there are people whom need not in stimulating of doing sport but the vast majority need to motivate.
