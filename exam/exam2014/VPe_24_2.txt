The current situation shows that young people is some counties are motivated to take a gap year and spend it working or travelling before applying to the university. 
In my opinion, that might be a good opportunity for everyone. 
To start with, taking a gap year is the perfect time to stop person's education for a while and get more experience so as to make the correct decision about the further life. It is of the greatest importance for everyone to understand clearly what he or she wants from this life and to be sure about the chosen path. If it does not happen, the person hopes and expectations will be ruined and he or she will be regretting for the rest of the life. The second reason is a possibility to find the love of their life for person. Clearly, it might lead to marriage which well marks the beginning of a new family and many people consider the family as one of the greatest values. The last reason for taking a gap tee is the opportunity to simply enjoy your time and the chance to get the unforgettable experience while traveling or doing other exciting activities. 
However, there are some clear drawbacks which might discourage person from taking a gap year. The first one is a possibility to lose any kind of interest for further studying, which might have the devastating effect on person's life because the university education is a current must- have requirement for getting a profitable job. The second drawback is the ability to start a family life which will definitely result in the lack of time and money for any kind of education. Although it might not to be an issue, it will have some consequences. 
To sum up, taking a gap year is the chance to change the life for a better side. However, everyone has to plan it beforehand and to know how he or she is going to benefit from it.
