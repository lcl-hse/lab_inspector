The diagrams give information about the ages of people who lived in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and the predictions for 2050. Looking first at the ages of the populations of Yemen. The majority of people who lived in Yemen in 2000 were children until 14 years old. Almost 47% of habitats were people from 15 until 59 years old. Finally, only 3,6% of the population of Yemen were older people aged 60+ years. According to predictions there number of 15-59 years old will rise up to 57,3% by the end of 2050. However, there will be a decrease in number of children aged 0-14 years. As for 60+ years old, it is believed that their number will increase only for 2,9%. Moving to the population in Italy. The majority of people in 2000 were 15-59 years old. Almost a quarter of all population was older people aged 60+ years. The minjority of people was children until 14 years old. It is suposed that by the end of 2050 the number of 60+ year old will rise up to 42,3%, but the number of 15-59 year old will decrease. The will also be a fall in number of children from 0 till 14 year old. To sum up the information, I'd like to say that both in Italy and in Yemen the majority of people will be 15-59 years old. However, the will be much more children in Yemen than in Italy.
