Early universiti was only to male students. But in 20 centry opened university to female students. Now all studients studies together. In all subject we can see equal proportion of male and female. 
I think that in university must be separate to male and female subjectsor must be competitions among students that studie this subject. Not all subject female studient can be studie. 
For example, math and economics is male subject. Most of famous people who was sucsses in this subject were men. And in future when the students will go to work the male studients much more easier to find well-peid job then female. The female studients much more successfull in creative subject as art, literature, language. This is their subject. The mind of female studients work much better in cultural subject. 
As the other hand many examples when female studients as successful in math, economics and techick subject. Nowadays many women successfull.
