Nowadays there are a lot of illnesses, which kill numerous of people around the world. Changing of human lifestyle has some very bad consequences, that have great impact on human's health. Some people think that doing sports is a sollution to the problems of our health and government should increase the quantity of sports objects in the country. Others suppose that this action would not have necessary affect and money should be spend more reasonably. Is it true? It is a highly significant issue. 
The first group of people supposes that new sport facilities promote healthy lifestyle and motivate children doing sport. Sports objects is a great tool in the fight against obesity, which causes a lot of deseases. People think that sport helps to build a good immune protection. 
Anyway the second group thinks that the policy of increasing the number of sports objects is not efficient, and it is wrong to spend on this a lot of money. such people say that some humans have restrictions, that do not allow them to do sport. Also doing sport can cause various injuries, which just make our healthy worse. 
Personally I suppose that the government should build new sports objects and promote healthy lifestyle. Anyway this policy should not be the only way of increasing the level of public health. We should also spend our money and attention on preventing some types of illnesses by doing special tests and analyses. We should make our environment more cleaner because the dirty air causes a lot of dangerous deseases. Also government should invest money into development of new ways of treatment. 
To sum up I would like to point out that we should not concentrate only on the one type of policy. The policy of increasing the number of sports objects has some advantages and disadvantages. And we should analise them and create different programms, which can help to solve the negative effect of such way of behaviour.
