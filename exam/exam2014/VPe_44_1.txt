The graph illustrates the share of population aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden and U.S.A. over a period of a century. 
The proportion of the elderers tends to have grown significantly by 2040 in all of the countries. The largest range can be seen in the case of Japan where the share has changed from 5% in 1940 to 27% in 2040. Whilst there was a negligible fall during the 6 decades up to 2005, since that the share has increased drastically. 
U.S.A. had the largest proportion of the population aged 65 and over back in 1940 (9%) and in 2040 it only takes the third place among the other countries. Sweden remaind the second with the population growth of 18%.
The sharpest increase of the share occurred in U.S.A. in between 2010 and 2020 when the portion of elderers' population more than doupled to 25% from 10%. To summarise the information that the graph provides there is a great trend of the elderers' population growth in these three countries.
