Many people say that creative artists should feel freedom in their speech, in what they create. There should be no geverment 'stops' on their way. 
It is generally agreed today that creative people have their own special opinion in some questions. It is true that the artists have another way to look at the same things. This people need to be heared like no other. To begin with, creative people can express their thoughts and feelings by the way of beauty. You can always say the right things but the singer with the wonderful songs about the same theme will be seen first. Secondly, people prefer to listen ideas of interesting and smart person. If you can shows that you are creative and clever person the people would like to listen to you and may be go to you. It is all clearly for everybody. 
On other hand, should there be the goverment restriction or it should not? Many artists use so special way to talk what they worry about, to introduce their own ideas. May be the goverment should look for the artists more responsible. 
It is undeniable that some some of what modern artists create could be very special and unforgetable for some people. It coul even shock somebody. 
Secondly, it is not rare situations when artists can say things, ideas, thought that the goverment do not like. We can think that the art and politics are hard to mix but it always could be. 
In my opinion goverment should look for artists but give them more freedom.
