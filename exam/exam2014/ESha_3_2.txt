Nowadays it is becoming cosier to express yourself by different ways. Some people do it by using words, some by using pictures of films. But is it clear to allow artist to do and to act how they want? 
There are so many ways to express your thoghts and feelings. People from ancient times show their ideas and thoughts by paintings and music. A lot of paintings of famous authors are held now in different galleries and big amount of people see them every day. But in long time ago just really talanted people become famous and well known artists. 
Now situation is different. Every person can become an artist. Sometimes, people don't think how their ideas and works would influence other people's minds. Too many untalanted and unproffesional people create music, movies and paintings. It is really hard for a good artist to show himself in such amount of untalanted people. 
In my opinion, government should allowed to express ideas and thoughts stronly really good artists. I their ideas are clear and they have something to show and tell people, they should do it. But if artist's works don't have any idea or logic or it can't bring anything good to public, there is nothing to show. 
Every person have a chance to show itself by any way he choose. But at first, we should think, if he really wants it and if she really have something to say and show to bublicity. Only really good works should be shown to people, because it can influence them and their minds a lot.
