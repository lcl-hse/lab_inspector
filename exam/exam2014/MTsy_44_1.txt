The pie charts shows the percentage of different ages of Yemen's and Italy's residents in 2000 and also try to predict thees amount for 2050. 
In Yemen population we can highlight the amount of children from 0 to 14 years old and it deals with the halth of the country. Howether, it is going to be near 37% in 2050 when the people of 15 to 59 years old will be the majority. For example, the biggest slice of pie chart of Italian populations in 2000 goes to these adults. Unfortunately, this pie chart below shows the decrease of 0-14 years old inhabitants of Italy (from 14,3% in 2000 to 11,5%). This poor tendence also connected with the increasing amount of elderly people (from 24,1% in 2000 to 42,3$ in 2050). 
According to this information we can make a comparisons between two countries. For example, Yemen's population have 57,3% of adults from 15 to 59 years old in predictable future, but in Italy it is only 46,2% and also have a tentence for decreasing. Moreover, the part of elderly people in Yemen now and in the 2050 is supposed to be much less than in Italy (4% in Yemen via 30% in Italy on avarage). 
To conclude, we can give an opinion that the projections for the future looks rather realistic. and it is important to take in mind all this data information.
