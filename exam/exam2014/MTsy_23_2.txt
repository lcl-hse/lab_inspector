In the present world with a fast-changing economy, great amount of new information and world-wide pollution people should take more care of their personal health. It can be done in many ways: taking part in different sport competitions, eating healthy and so on. But can doing sports regularly really improve public health or not? Let us discuss the problem. 
Nowadays many people in many cities, towns and country-sides start thinking about their health and numbrous ways to improve it. Some say that if we increase the amount of sport facilities, such a problem will vanish. Well, it is right in some way. For instance, many people are too busy to spend long hours to get to any kind of fitness clubs. It means that if the general number of those clubs rise, people will probably visit them more often. Secondly, some people can't afford visiting a fitness clubs due to their high costs. Nevertheless, some sport facilities could be built right in the street, where such people will use them for no charge. 
On the other hand, building expensive sport facilities doesn't mean that people will use it. Today people are becoming more and more lazy due to the significant technology improvements, that make our life easier. it means that even if any kind of sport facilities is installed, it is only for people to decide, wheather to use them or not. Such installments are also often vandalised by teenagers, that makes their building pointless from the very beginning. 
To sum it up, I would like to say that I do not find the strategy of increasing the amount of sport facilities useful for the modern world. If people really care about their health, they will find all ways to improve it.
