The line graph illustrates the usual amount of daily elecrticity consumption on average summer and winter days. And the pie chart gives the information on the percentage of electricity used for different household activities. 
We can see from the first graph that people need almost twice as much electricity in winter as in summer. As the pie chart shows that 52,5% of electricity is used for heating, which is most amount of elecricity used, we can see why winter is a more elecricity-demand season than summer. The line graph shows the lowest demand for electricity during early morning hours and then it reaches it's highest points in the evening, as people tend to use more electricity in the evenings for heating rooms, for lighting, TV when they come home from work. Although, during the period between 16 to 21 hours in summers there's a slight drop comparing to winter, where the graph gradialy grows. 
All in all, both graphs give information about amount of electricity used in England and combined they show a more complex image of electricity situation both in winter and summer.
