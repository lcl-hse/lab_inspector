There is a widespread issue in many countries about students behaviour. Every school in every country has its own ways to solve this problem. I'd like to state my point of view and suggest a probable solution. 
To speak about causes, I think there are a lot. For instanse, even if only one student behaves himself in a wrong way, it may lead to many student who will act the same. It explains collective behaviour, where the easiest way to stand out oneself is to break rules. What is more, unproprate actions may interrupt to the subject which means lack of understanding and then knowledge. In my opinion, it's very important to maintain the silence and focus during the class. 
As a solution, I'd make lessons less strict, because sometimes when you're told to do what you don't want to, you're likely to do right the opposite. The same is in class. Moreover, I'd give students more free time between lessons or have some more time to spend with each other to understand them and let them get to know each other more. As a teacher, I'd show them the opportunities of good behaviour, would make some grants for ones who presented themselves a good way. 
In conclusion I'd like to strike out that even if the problem of behaviour in schools is common to every country, students themselves are not. In my opinion, for changing somebody's behaviour you have to know a student well, so it appears to be a personal approach, because you cannot change everybody using the same method. If you know the person, you know the way.
