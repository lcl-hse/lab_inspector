The issue of freedom of thought and its expression stands among the most urgent matters in the modern world and the question of the extend to which artists should be given the freedom to express their ideas is widely discussed nowadays. The attitude to this issue is a serious bone of contention not only between politicians and critics but also between ordinary art-lovers. So let us have a closer look on this problem. 
According to the opinion which can be at some point called conservative, art exists to arouse the sense of beauty and harmony in human's heart, to amuse and please and by this improve them. So, to this point of view, art should not dwell upon the themes that are considered inappropriate. Though other people consider freedom of self-expression the inalienable quality of any art. So it meets the question of freedom to express one's opinion. Not only says artists what he aims to say but iften dwells upon some serious political or social problems in his works. That is what makes the problem so urgent. Still there are pieces of art that can easily hurt someone's feelings or are simply disgusting. But in this case another, complicated question arises - is this really art? 
For me the freedom of art is essential for the democratic society. Although some pieces of it can be shoking or even somitimes repulsive to some extent, I believe that they have a sensible message to the audience and meet the common moral criteria they have all rights to exist.
