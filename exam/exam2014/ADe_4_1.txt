This table provides some information concerning the employment of each age group in certain sectors in the UK in 1998 and 2006. 
In the beginning the youngest group used to work most in building whereas in 2006 the most significant number occupied in technology. There is no surprise that this sector was the most popular among 26-35 and 36-45 groups in 2006. People aged 26-65 were involved in hotel and catering in 2006 more than in 1998. Evidentely, the youngest and the oldest groups were more occupied in education in 1998. The situation with middle aged people was rather stable (except for the technology sphere - there had been a remarkable increase, the same as for all ages). 
Overall, we see that building used to attract more people in 1998, but in 2006 it was the time for technology. Education and also hotel catering sectors, anyway, didn't see any huge changes.
