The choise of university, faculty and speciality is very important in future life of students. That's why students should estimate all advantages and disadvantages of different opportunities for studying and undestand well what type of work they are going to do in their future life. 
For those decisions people need enough time. That's why in some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. I think, it's a good idea. This time gives students opportunity to get wonderful experience. During this period of time students are supposed to try different kinds of work and understand better which job is closer to them or where they will be more successful. 
It was shown that during this year a lot of students travel to other countries. It makes you decide where you want live in the future and can also influence you to study abroad. Communication with people frome foreign cultures gives you a lot of experience you can learn more about different types of job. 
Unfortunately, I hadn't this year. I can say that after two years at university I understand much more better which proffesion I'd like to choose. If I had gap year I would choose another speciality. 
On the other hand, I believe that there are some disadvantages of having this year. During this time you can lose your knowledge and it will be harder to pass exams on the good mark. This year also gives you a plenty of free time what can encourage you to do some bad things. It's also possible that after one year you won't wish to study at university. 
In conclusion, I think that the advantages of this opportunity outweigh the disadvantages and students should use this time.
