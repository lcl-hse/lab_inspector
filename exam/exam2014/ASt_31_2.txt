Scientists and researchers say that genetic influence in our personality is more powerful than our experience from life. 
From my point of view, this question is really complicated to be sure on 100%. I'm absolutely agree with that fact the characteristics we are born with with control our destiny in majority situations. For example, a man with perfect body, good physical shape and ideal health can think about being a sportman, an astronaut or what ever he want. If a girl has a powerful math skill and an amazing memory she can try herself in science sphere. My idea is that our genetic characteristics, as a rule, could help us to understand in which sphere we can do our best. It's hard to believe that a person 1,35 meters tall will be good at basketball or a student with a bad memory will become a math professor. 
On another hand it isa bry mistake to think that people cannot change themselves into others. Everything is depending on your will. There are many examples of people who had some weakness but overcame them. We can confirm that even in society of ideal people it is possible to reach your dream. There is no borders, if you really try. 
Unfortunately, researches are working with statistics and in majority situations don't have enough will for change themselves. That's why we can say that genetic influence on us is more powerful. 
In conclusion, I'd like to emphasize that these two ideas have enough arguments to be exist. So, everybody should decide by themselves which is more suitable for them. Use your genetic characteristics and improve them or try to overcome your weaknesses because of your dreams.
