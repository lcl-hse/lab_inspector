The two charts represent the qualifications for men and women in Australia in 1999. 
It can be seen that there were much more men that held a skilled vocational diploma in 1999 than women - 90% to 10% respectively. Women were more likely to stay undergraduate (68% compared to 32%). The bachelor's degree was sporead almost equally between men and women. As for the postgraduate dipoloma and the master's degree, it is noticeable that men took advantage these (70% to 30% for the postgraduate diploma and 69% to 49% for the master's degree). 
To sum up, we should say that there were more men than women among the ppost-school graduates. The only qualification that was held by men and women equalky was the bachelor's degree. And it's not a surprise. Men were boirn to work hard and make money for their living and for their families when women often become housewives after school and do not graduate from a university or college. The statistics on the charts clearly shows this trend.
