In the modern world the health problems are quite important for population and it is necessary to find solutions for such problem as global health fall. Some people suggest that increasing of sport facilities is the best solution and it will give results, but there are a lot of opponents of this point of view. So, this problem is wonrh to be discussed. 
On the one hand, such actions will have some positive results. For example, when the amount of sport facilities increase, there will be none children, who will be keen of sports. They will do sports since their childhood, so it is a chance to grow health nation. But the result will be seen only in the future, so is difficult to help adult person to improve their health, using this method. 
On the other hand, such actions are not so effective, because the majority of our country population consists of adult people and pensioners. And it isn't effective for their poor health to do different sports to improve it. They need to have high quality medicine to support their health. And the government should invest in medicine area, especially in pharm area. If me have innovations in our medicine, we can help our adult people and pensioners to live long life. And it will be the best solution of public health problem. 
As for my opinion, I consider, it is necessary to realize complex actions to achieve a real result. Our government should spend money on improving sport facilities for next generations and invest money on improving medicine level for adult people. There is no doubt, that it is a long process, because it requires a huge invest capital and the productive work of medicine scientists, but it is the single method to decide public health problem productively.
