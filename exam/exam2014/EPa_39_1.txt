It can be clearly seen that in 2000 number of 15-59 years ald people was about a half of population, but teens till 14 years was accounted for fifty per cent. A significant minority was old people. According to predictions for 2050 it markedly seen the growth of middle-aged population and the decline of 60+ years' old people.
