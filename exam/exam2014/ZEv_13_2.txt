In many countries, the student have different moral characteristic. There are a lot of kind teaching for students. For example, in arabic counties existe traditionall "teaching" when student must appreciate and respect of tradition, family, and according then in this countries good behaviour. The anothers countiest, for example - USA, terrible behaviour. Cause this country is free and democraty for tradition. 
For my opinion first cause is family. It plays very important role in life everyone. Second cause is cociality. Saying tell me who are your friend so I tell you who you are. The truth! Cociality influance to person. 
So I think, the parents must paying for attention to children. Very important give them right knowledghes for themself future life (in school, for example). Also the goverment must to help to spesial programmes. 
In conclusion, student behaviour is modern problem. Nowadays student don't want studying. He prefer spend to time with computer, iphone. After that he is begginning too lazy. So student behaviour hard to control.
