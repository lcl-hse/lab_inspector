Community service is an important part of social life in all countries. But not all people want to help or work without receiving any reward, so people believe that unpaid services need to be included in high school programmes, because it's a good start of socializing for scholars. 
On the one hand, charity and other help is important, because there are many people who need help. Mature people have work and families, so they don't have enough time for community service. But scholars have time and all opportunities to help. They are young and active, majority of them are optimistic and really interested in communicating. So many people believe that high school programmes can be a good foundation for socializing and communication between young and old, healthy and diseased people. 
On the other hand, there are many lazy and pessimistic teenagers nowadays, they don't care about other's lives and don't want to help or work without receiving anything. So including unpaid community service in school programmes can cause real problems with this type of children. 
In my opinion, we need more people to work in social sphere, because pure kindness and wish to "give hand" is one of the main human virtues. But man should really want and wish to help, or work can become annoying and unwanted, especially if it is unpaid. 
Finally, community service is very important in society. People should learn to work, communicate and help from the young ages. But it's personal choice to help or not, so people should be free to do that choise.
