There is an opinion that people become less healthy nowadays than they were some years ago. And some people believe that such problem arises because people do not enough sport because of lack of sports facilities. But there is also the another point of view, which says that increasing of the number of sports facilities would be not enough to motivate people and it would not have enough effect on public health. 
On the one hand, those who want to improve public health by making people do sports are right: sport is the easiest and the most entertaining way to be fit and have good health. Moreover, the results of regular workouts motivate people not to stop, once they started. We saw many Paraolympics champions not long time ago and we could be motivated by their self-confidence, being ambitions and being best even without arms and legs. 
But on the other hand, doing sport is not acceptable to everybody: there are some people, who have health problems but are not allowed to do physical excercises. Also, we have to remember that the organism of a man who does professional sport become tired much faster then organisms of people who do not. 
To sum up, in my own view it is needed not only making everybody do sport, but an individual ways of improving health. Probably, some projects should be organized, which would provide different people making themselves healthier in different ways, provide individual program of improvement and self-development to each who would want to. The programs, which would include not only training but choosing a meal program and so on.
