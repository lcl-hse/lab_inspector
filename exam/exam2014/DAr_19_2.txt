It is judged that sedentary lifestyle, which is commonly spread nowadays, has caused a range of problems that have to be solved in order to improve public health. Conserning such a issue some people claim the growth in quantity of sports centres to be the best approach, while others argue that method will be less effective than series of different measures. Frankly speaking, a boom in the number of sports facilities won't make an expected change as such places can attract the majority of already fit citizens. Therefore, everyone should make their own contribution to the health improvement. For instance, people might use bicycles instead of private cars to loose weight and breather the fresh air on the way to work. Moreover, social institutions shoul introduce a variety of outdoor cources and trips to make teenagers and, perhaps, their parents to spend time neither surfing the internet nor watching TV. Even organization of sports events can result in reduction of some illnesses. Furthermore, governments may impose a special tax for high-fat food. To sum up, the rise in amount of sports centres will not change the current situation unless people will understand the importance of healthy lifestyle and find a true desire in themselves to work out.
