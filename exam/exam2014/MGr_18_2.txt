If you ask a person whether he wants to be happy, he definitely will answer "yes". But only happiness is so important for people? And what does it mean to be happy? 
As for me, I suppose that being happy means that you are sastisfied with your life in one ore another way. Personally, I think that happiness is too subjective to define, because for every person this word has it's own meaning. For example, recognition can make happy an artist or an actor, a new-born baby makes happy it's parents and so on. We can also remind us an example from history: after the end of The Second World War every family was waiting for its soldiers. Undoubtedly, people were cheerful when their relatives and friends came back home alive. If we achieve our goals, we also feel happiness. Moreover, love can bring us lot of good emotions. Chehov, the russian famous writer, even said concerning this theme: "Happy people don't notice time". (it was because The hero of the book was in love). 
However, what do we need exactly to become happy? No one knows. To my mind, you just need to understand what is the most important thing for you in your life and make everything you can to achieve this goal. On the contrary, even small things, like smile, can make us cheerful. So it is not so difficult to be happy. 
To crown it all, hardly could anybody define what happiness is and how to become happy, but don't forget that life itself can bring joy, so relax and be happy!
