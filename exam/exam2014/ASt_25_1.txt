The table provide the information about the underground railway system in six big cities such as: London, Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, Koyoto, Los Angeles. 
Firstly, there are four coloms in the table including the name of city. Second gives information about the date, when the underground was opened. Next column shows the amount of kilometres of rate. And the last, but not the least colomn provides information about how many passengers use the railway station per year (information gives in millions). It should be noticed that the most oldest underground is situated in London, it was opened in 1863 while underground in Los Angeles opened only in 2001. For instance, underground in London also is longest than other in table. But unfortunately underground of London is not the most popular because the biggest amount of visitors (1927) has underground of Tokyo. Underground of Paris also has great number of visitors, but it is not had such long kilometres of route (199). 
Overall, the dates in table show that it earlier opened an underground that more visitor it will have in future. Because it would be popular and interesting to visit such old and beautifull stations which were built in the past.
