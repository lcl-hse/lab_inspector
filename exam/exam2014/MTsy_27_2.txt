Nowadays, there are a lot of different problems in our world. The one of them is worsening of public health. There is some opinions about the ways of improvement. Some people believe that public health will be improved thanks to development of sports culture, when others consider that it needs other measures. I think, that both positions are right partly. In other words, improvement public health requires a complex decision. 
Increasing the number of capabilities for doing sports will develop a general culture of people such as habit to do physical activities, having a moral power and energy, following healthy diet, the day's shedule and much more. All this factors have a significant influence on our health, and opportunities to have and exploit sports facilities will develop them. However, increasing the number of sports facilities gives a lot of opportunities, there are some different substantial aspects. 
The government have to provide people with all the necessities such as good medicine which help people with a service, and treatments. Moreover, there have to be a stable economic situation, saving the environment in the world. Overcrowding of cities leads to a high level of pressure for people, that has negative psychological effects, that is why all the contributing factors should be take in consideration. public health depends on a level of industrialisation and globalisation because these phenomenas create a consequences for quality of goods, products, their necessary quantity for a benign existence of nations. 
It can be concluded, that sports facilities may cause an improvement of public health but it needs much more complex actions such as creating a convenient infrastructure, developing a good, stable economy and policy which requires a lot of time and other resources.
