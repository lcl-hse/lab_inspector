For last 20 years in our post-industrial society the most common problem was the finding of true happiness. Let's sink in on this topic and discover why is happiness is so difficult to find? Many psychologists says that true happiness is unity of our lives and way to sucess that we dream of. If they are together you will be in good state of mind. 
Example for that statement is research of the Canadian lifestyle-coach Todd Benkerstone. He tested 25 richest men of Canada and interviewed them. All off them said that work and business, in their opinion, is fun and simple. They havea lways dreamed of having business and when they buit one it gave them a lot of happiness. 
Why happiness is so difficult to define by ordinairy people? it is simple: We do not know what to do with our lives. Great french writer and philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called is "existentional crisis". Sartre said that this crisis is the main root of our happiness and oven health problems. In my life I also was corrupted by thi horrible feeling, but my family, teachers and friends bring me to life and show me path that I'm going on at the moment. 
What is important to do to achieve true happiness? You should undertand what are you dream of, after that set goals to achieve and start to move on this life-path. My "panacea" to contradict unhappiness is meditation and yoga. Eastern techniques cures many mind traumas and heals the soul of person who used itb Philosophy and religion is also may be a good choice to achieving happiness. Why? They set goals to us and smoothy forces us to move on, to achieve it. 
To conclude the essay I should say that no matter taht we live in fast, sometimes cruel world. For true happiness we should stay for a moment and asked to themselves: "Why am I here?". The answer of that question is the our personal path. There is no two similar fingerprints. And, finally, journey on this path brings us a lot of love, friendship, new emotions, fun and, as a result, true happiness.
