The problem of improving public health is extremely important nowadays. There are various ways and ideas of changing the situation for the best. On the one hand, it is believed that rising number of sports facilities is the key concept of improving public health. Obviously, when people have a great variety of sports they can choose it is rather easier to make them do these sports and stay healthy. Moreover, for many people it is really important to have an opportunity to do their favourite kinds of sports close to their homes. That is why the rising number of sports facilities in different areas can inspire people to become more sportive. It is also extremely important to have more sports facilities both for indoor and outdoor sports to make people spend more time outside their houses. On the other hand, increasing number of sports facilities does not always mean increasing number of people who go in for sports. So, other ways of inspiring people to stay healty and keep fit should exist. For example, it can be rising number of healthy food in shops and restaurants. Government and local authorities may use social advertising of social campaigns to increase the popularity of healthy lifestyle. Companies can provide medical insurances and complex medical treatment for their workers to help them to control their health. In my opinion, it is wrong to underestimate any of the ways of improving public health. All of them help to support different spheres of it. In conclusion, it is important to give people more sports equipment, healthy food and medical help to make them stay healthy. One of these methods cannot bring the effect they all can bring together.
