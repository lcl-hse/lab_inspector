These bar charts represents the information about population in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and 2050. Generally, it is clearly seen that the age of population will change in future. 
The striking feature in these charts is the fact that in both years Italy has much less children of 0-14 years that Yemen, 14,3% vs 50,1% in 2000 and 11,5% vs 37,0% respectively. However, the number of senior people in countries differs as well. While Yemen had only 3,6% of people aged over 60 years in 2000, Italy had about a quarter of population as senior people. It is also important to note, that the main part of citizents in Italy and Yemen is made of working people, when there were more children that other groups. 
All in all, there is a tendency for both countries to increase number of senior people and decriese share of children in their population in future.
