The two given charts show information on the ages of the population of Italy and Yemen in 2000. Two next charts give information about projections for 2050. 
We can see that 50,1% of population in Yemen is children 14 years old and below. This charactirise Yemen which has high rate of birth now. But how we can see, this trend fall gradually and in 2050 this percent is already 37. The most huge part will be group "15-59 years", which percent will raise from 46,3 to 57,3. 
Population of Italy consists from 14,3% of children below 14, 24,1% of group "60+", 61,6% - "15-59". Italy has not such high rate of birth like Yemen. In 2050 it is going to be even more matchable because of smaller percent of children (11,5%). As we can see, group of people older than 60 years will be almost doubled in 2050 in Italy (from 24% to 42,3%). And first of all, it causes by higher level of medicine. The same trend we see in Yemen, but at much lower level from 3,6% to 5,7%.
