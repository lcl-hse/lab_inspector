Some researches reveal that the personal traits, which are inherited may dominate people development much more that the experience, which they gain during their life. However, it is a controversial question, wheather genetic has deeper influence on than their nurture. 
It is generally accepted, that genetic code defines physical and emotional features, which people have. That is why children and their parents are alike in so many ways such as: appierence, character or even abilities to science as well as art talents. It is an inevitable biological process, which all the children are involved in. 
On the other hand, the process of socialization may extremely determine personal development. As a matter of fact, children absolutely depend on people who they mix with. Obviously, parents may have a significant influence on the ones. Children always prefer to adopt adult's outlook on life and behaviour as well. 
Furthermore, people may have so unpredictable and powerfull experience during their life, that leads to striking people's changes. According to famous psychologists any brightly occasion in childhood may determine people's convictions, characters and moral principles. 
In my opinion the whole factors contributing to the socialization such as: society, peer pressure, family, social institutes and others have the same influence on people's personality as the genetic code has. Only a collaboration of these options may shape individuals completely. 
If it was not true, all the scientist would have been able to predict people's behaviour from the moment they are born. 
Finally, I would like to say, that I am strongly believe that people's evoluation and personal development are defined by variety of factors, which are contributed both to genetic as well as socialization.
