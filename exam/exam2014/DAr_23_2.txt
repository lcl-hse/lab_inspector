The importance of sport has increased nowadays. There a lot of opportunities to do some sport activities. A lot of people think, that the best way to make public health better is to increase the number of sport facilities. It could give us a wide range of choice and we will do every kind of sport we want. But there are people, who say that this method of making sport important would have not so huge effect on public health. I also think so. There are a lot of other factors, that can attract the public to sports activities. For example, marketing and advertisement. I think every government should make a social advertisements with the native football players or other sportsmen, where they should tell to us about the importance of sport and healthy way of life. Another good way to improve public health is to build stadiums, playgrounds for children. Children is our future, and they should be healthy since their born. To sum up, I can say, that the health and interest to sport is very individual to every person. Only when I would understand the necessary of doing sport, I can make my life healthier. This problem is very actual nowadays. All people should care about their health.
