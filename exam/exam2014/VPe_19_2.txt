The tendency of taking a "gap year" before going to the university has grown in the last years, but mostly in Western countries. However, this idea might be misunderstood by some Russian people. 
To my mind, taking a gap year can be very beneficial for a future student. It is an exellent opportunity to see the world and to fond out what you really want to do in life. Besides, you can relax after the final exams. I fully understand those who decide to take 2 year break, and, to be honest, I was once suggested to do it myself. 
But I didn't do it. I see a lot of disadvantages in the idea of gap year, especially for a future Russian student. First of all, if you got high marks on the state exam, which provides you with an opportunity to enter the University without any payments, you might lose your scholarship the year after. Same happens to the winners of school competitions who are given a chance to become a student with scholarship despite the results of the state exam. And of course, in Russia it is thought to be obligatory to have not only a bachelor, but also a magister degree (unlike in most European countries), so you feel the need to start earlier in order not to become an "eternal student". 
I fullheartedly believe, that many Russian students would take a gap year if was conciniant for them. I know a lot of people who dreamed about an opportunity to work or travel before the university, but were forced to become students right after school. 
If the procedure of the exams could be improved, so scholarship stayed the same every year and the results could be used during two or three years after taking the exams, gap years would become possible to be taken by many people. 
Making a conclusion, I consider a year break after finishing school a good idea, but slightly possible in our conditions.
