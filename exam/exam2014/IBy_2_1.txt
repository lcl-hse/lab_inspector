The table provides information about the underground railway systems in six cities, including the date of opening, length of route and the number of passengers per year. 
To begin with, underground railway systems in London, Paris and Tokyo have been opened much earlier than in other cities. This means that these systems have been developing since the previous century and, as a result, have longer routs. The longest rout of subway is in London and it is 394 kilometres. Length of railway in Paris and Tokiyo are 199 km and 155 km, that is around 2 times lower than in London. 
Concerning three other cities, it is noticeable that the length of rout and the amount of passengers per year in Washington DC are significantly higher than in Kyoto and in Los Angeles. Moreover, the subway in Washington DC was opened five years earlier than in Kyoto and twenty five years earlier than in Los Angeles. 
In conclusion, the highest levels of kilometres of route and of the number of passengers per year have the cities, which were opened earlier than others.
