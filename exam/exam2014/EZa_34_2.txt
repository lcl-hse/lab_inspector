Nowadays it's much spoken about the main objective of human living, it's real value and right ways of spending it. As for as I'm concerned, the majority determinates it as happiness and its achievement or, moreover, maintenance during all the life. However, a few people can define this motion and explain clearly what it is because of enormous amount of feelings, emotions and associations related with happiness. Besides that, reasons of feeling happy can be different for everyone. 
Actually, young people are less conscious than adult and, consequently, are not able to define what usually brings them happiness. After 25 years old every person becomes determining itself, accostumbrating to some habbits and preferences, etc. Adult people often clearly know what the need to improve their mood, to feel better and to experience unforgettable emotions. Everyone chooses for his own factor that brings him positive emotions and uses it. 
It's quite clear that often the real factor is a great secret, hard to tell it to others, or it's difficultly achievable, Kare or somethnig else. In this case, to my mind, happiness can be achieved by healthy lifestyle, minimum of stress and dissappointments, positive people around and job that you like. 
On the other hand, it's hard to achieve happiness being lonely, without any support. Definetely, every person needs to be loved, cared and enough socialized. As a matter of fact, such feelings bring to endorphins and it means "happiness" in the physical level. 
Finally, I'd like to mention that i agree with the majority of people who say that achieving happiness is the main human objective. Despite of different senses of this motion in everyone's mind and complicated rout to the final aim, people need to be strong in their desire to experience all the possible factors and final the unique one, that brings them feeling of being happy.
