It is a well-spread practice in western countries to take some academic break for a year. Students, who have just graduated from the high school and who do not know what to expect from their life, interests, hobbies are usually into making such decisions. 
On the one hand, it's very nice to have a year break between 11 years study and the following 4 years of education, if you're planning to go to the university. During this year, when all time you have is your time, you can decide what do you want to do. Maybe, you want to gain some experience and start working, but it's very low probability, that the job, you will get, will be with a significant salary. Probably you'll be selling hot-dogs, pizzas and so on but nothing connected with career of some lawyer. Or maybe you're able to have a rest travelling around the Earth and getting aware about traditions and customs of other countries. You can even combine your interests and after you get some amount of money go travelling! That's the best way of spending your gap year as it seems to me. 
But there are people, who're against the "rest year". So often, it's your parents. They think only about your education, they care about your friends, your hobbies. And this is reasonable, I should say. Because when you're presented to your own at the age of 17 - 19, you can easily be seducted by some woman, who is probably willing to be engadged with you, if your family is a wealthy one. There are a lot of temptations, that you probably will want to try, to experience. And your parents are not against it, they just suppose, that when you have some limits, bounds, you'll be trying them out step-by-step. Not all at once, so that you'll be in a big trouble. 
In my personal opinion, if you fell, that you're not ready for the future self-development in university you should take a gap year; But during this period you must be controlled by your family. They always take care of you, and they won't resist this time too.
