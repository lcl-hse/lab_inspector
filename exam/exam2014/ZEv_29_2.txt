Nowadays people often talk about puples and students and the main problem is their behaviour. Many of them think that it is depend on teacher and I agree with this opinion. 
On the one hand, we can say that teacher is a main person in the classroom and he or she must organize the process of work and people. For example, in the Ancient Greece many philosophers created schools and learned there a lot of people who wanted to be in the center of the political debate or to be like scientist. They did not organize the process like a real education in nowadays. So, they tried to learn students how to think and discuss with them. 
On the other hand, it is also depend on students at school and their (_). For example, in German in bad schools teachers cannot sometimes shout at young people. So, students can eat, shout in the classroom and do not go to the school. Moreover, when young people come to the other country they continue to do what they have done before and teachers cannot do anything. 
All in all, there are many causes of this problem, but I think that the main is how teacher can organize the process.
