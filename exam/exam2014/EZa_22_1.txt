The graph gives information about the amount of electricityconsumptionin summerand winter, while the pie chart demonstrates the different purposes for electricity use in England. 
In the graph it's seen that the demand for electricity in winter is two times highet that in summer. The winter trend starts with 35000 points, reaches a peak at 40000 units and then has rather stable increase till 45000 points. However, there is a significant decrease after this which finishes at 35000 units. 
In the pie chart one could see that electricity use for heating rooms and water is on the first place with 52,5 %. The next in the list is the use for ovens, kettles and washing machines -it has 17, 5%. The amount of electricity that is used for lightings, TV, radio and for different electronic machines, such as Vacuum cleaners, is equal 15% for each. 
To seem up, one could see that the amount of electricity that is used for heating takes a half of the whole electricity consumption. So, it's obvious that the consumption shoofease, because people have to heat the houses and themselves.
