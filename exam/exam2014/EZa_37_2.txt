Most of people will definetely agree that hapiness is one of the most things in human's lifes. Hundreads of writers, poets, and other artists tryed to represent it in their works, hundreads of philosophers, psychologists, and even biologists explored it. But despite of all this efforts, happiness is still a mistery for us. Why it is so extremely difficult to define this thing? 
There are a lot of opinions about what hapiness really is. Some people would say that the only way to find happiness is to live calm and comfortable life: to have friends, kids, your own hous, beautiful wife. Others would disagree with them and say that happiness can only be discovered in unexpected events, battles, contests etc. Such people need adrenaline to be happy, Also, there are some persons, who strongly believe that we need to create something to achieve happiness, we always need self-expression to be happy. It is not necessary arts they are talking about: you can express yourself by doing practically anything, you just need to love it. 
Other people find happiness while helping others. Such people say that humans are created to help each other, to make each others lifes better. 
I am not sure what happiness means for me, however I am pretty sure that it is so hard to describe happiness because it is not conditions of your life but your attitude towards these conditions. Of course, this attitude depends strongly on personal qualities o every person and ever person must define what happiness is by this own. It si not easy, but I believe that it is extremely important for every human being.
