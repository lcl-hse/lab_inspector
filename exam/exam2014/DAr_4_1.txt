The pie charts which I will describe shows the changes in structure of Yemen's and Italy's populations from 2000 to 2050 with prognoze. Firstly, I will talk about Yemen. In 2000 the biggest part in whole proportion was taken by children from 0 to 14 years old: 50,9% were small citizens, Also, 46,3% were "middle-age" people - from 15 to 59 years. The smallest part - 3,6% - was the group of 60-years-old and more people. In 2050 scientist predict changes: 57,3% will include middle-age people, the quantity of eldery people will increase to 5,7%. The situation in Italy is not the same. For instance, in 2000 the quantity of children was the smallest from whole proportion, and people 15 to 59 years old had a biggest part of pie - 61,6%. In 2050 the picture will change a little: the smallest and biggest parts will be the same, but the quantity of children will decrease, the part of middle-age people will plummet too, and the quantity of eldery people will rocket and double. To sum up, it is necessairy to say that we can see a tendency of falling the quantity of children and increasing the part of eldery people, but in different proportions in every country.
