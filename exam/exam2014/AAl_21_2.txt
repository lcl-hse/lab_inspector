The topic of difference between male and female in different spheres of studing is very important in modern world, because nowadays question of equal rights and opportunities is topical for large amount of people and organization. Some of them are sure that universities should study equal numbers of men and women in every spheres. I strongly disagree with them and I think that some subject is more benifit for male and some others for female. 
It is no doubt, that students should have equal opportunities to study every subject. Every person is individual and everyone has special skills. But usually some subjects, spheres and direction have no similar popularity between boys and girls. For instance, some subjects is needed in enormous force such as building or some technique specialization, engeneering. Obviously, girls are able to take knowledge about this subjects but they cannot to work and use their knowledge in practice. So their studing and education are useless, aren't they? University should not tell "You must study here because you are a male or female", they should give us chance to make a choice, choose a right direction and make a decision. If universities give equal access to different direction for women and men they can choose so we get modern society with develop professions where every person do work which can be done by their individual skills. 
To sum up, the general idea of modern education is not equal amount of girls and boys but is iqual access to this education!
