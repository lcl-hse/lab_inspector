The charts show the main reasons for study among students of different ages and the amount of employer support they received. 
According to the first chart, we can see two reasons for studying among students who are under 26 and up to over49 years old. The reasons are "for career" and "for interest". Obviously, the first reason has the most significant meaning for students who are under 26 and it decreases from one age group to another. But the situation is different with the reason "for interest". It is obvious that a very few students who are under 26 consider this reason important, but we can't say so about people over 49. The second reason has it's increase from one age group to another. 
Actually, the second chart shows that employers support most people who are under 26 years old, then who are 26 - 29 and then who are over 49. 
To sum up, both charts gives an information that students who are under 26 years old are prefer to study for career and also they were given a lot of support by employer.
