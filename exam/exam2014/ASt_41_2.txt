I want to talk about characteristics we are born with and how they influence on our personality. To start with, we should consider that such influence exists, because without this point we can move on in out little research. 
If we considered that there such characteristics and we say that there are many of them, why we don't start with the main one? As for me, the main thing is that people are born with potencial, but they are not equal it is like cars, some of them have more horse power then others and that's why you can do nothing with it. People study and work hard, but not all of then will win Nobel prize or become a bolionere and that's because of potencial. We can make our little theoretical experiment, let's take two random people a put them in same conditions from their burth to death and we will see that they won't reach same result, one will be better that another (of course you have got % that they will be equal! but it is unlikely or just too small %). This characteristic is just like IQ, some people are clever than other, this is characteristic you are born with and you can do anything with it, you can strnyle with it or just deny it, but you have your limit and that's all. 
To sum up, I want to say that in all ways your must study and work hard, because even if you are talented or not you must work hard to reach your great goals.
