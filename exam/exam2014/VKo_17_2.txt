The most important freedom today is freedom to have a say. There are 2 opinions, that creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas. The other opinion conclude the idea, that government should restrict the freedom of say in this part of society. On the one hand the creative artists play a big role in our life, therefore the ideas of these people are very important for society. These ideas can have negative consequnse for a government, becouse the creative artists have a good opportunities to express a negative idea (for example to destroy government) in pictures, films or music. 
I can say that sometimes these ideas are dangerous. On the other hand we cannot say about governent restrictions in democratic society. 
All people not only creative artists, can say their own opinion. I think that it is very important for society to have a knowlege about a different points of view. In such situation the people can make a chose: what is it true, and what is it false? and the governent should represent these ideas, but it is just ideal model of a political pluralism system. We can notice, that creative people make a progress in society. For example in Russia the ideas of creative artists became the main ideas of our opposition. Our government notice it and restrict a freedom to have a say. I think, that it destroys our society. At the same time we should understand, who has a human ideas. I think that government should limit ideas, wich destroy the society and have a negative influence on the citizen, who live in this country.
