It is widely agreed that happiness is one of the most important notions which is used to discuss a human life. Almost everyone can say that state of happiness can be considered as the ultimate goal of every individual life. But this notion can hardly be defined, because different people tend to anderstand it differently. Happiness is a pretty subjective term. Achieving happiness is a hard task, and several important factors of it can be named. 
Firstly, it should be said that a person should choose occupation and work that will be the most enjoyable to him. A person can't be happy if he hates his work or he is not aware of what he should do his life. Profession tha gives a person feeling of satisfaction is one of the key factors in achieving happiness. 
The second factor is love. To my mind, deep emotional contact is necessary component of the state of happiness. Feeling of loneliness and detachment from the others can be considered as one of the main obstacles on the way to a fully enjoyed life. 
Other factors can be named, but I think that love and profession form the core of the happy life. These are two goals that ought to be achieved to make one's life bright and happy.
