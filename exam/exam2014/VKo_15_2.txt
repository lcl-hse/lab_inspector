It cannot be denied that the freedom of expression is one of the most significant rights in modern democratic societies. That is why the freedom to express your own ideas is included in the most of Constitutions of liberal countries. Some people think that creative artists should be given the ability to express their own opinion in whichever way they wish, so the government must not control this process. However, another part of society may think that the creative artists shouldn't express their ideas in the way they wish and the government should restrict this. 
In my opinion, creative artists should always be given the freedom of expression their own opinion and should not afraid of government restrictions. First of all, it will be a good example for all people to express their own opinion and the pluralism of opinions and ideas will lead to real democratic state. Secondly, creative artists can create a rich culture with different types of buildings, pictures and films which will be able to please all members of the society. Thirdly, the pluralism of ideas of creative artists can be valuable for creating effective infrastructure and economy. 
In the other hand, the freedom of expression your own ideas has its drowbacks. Firstly, lot's of ideas can lead to misunderstanding in society and, consicuantly, to disunity in public opinion (remember the case of Pussy Riots, for example). Moreover, creative artists can give some wrong ideas to the society, which can have bad impacts (for example, the idea of smoking has bad impacts of population's health). 
In conclusion, the issue of expression's freedom is very contraversive. As I have said before, it will be better if government will give the creative artists the ability to tell about their ideas without any fear of punishment. I suppose, it will make our culture richer.
