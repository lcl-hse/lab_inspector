Creative artist are person who have different mind then other. They do unusuall things or ideas that can fluence on thinking. 
Nowadays goverment control it. In different countryes this control have different level and many times it is too much. 
I agree that goverment must give more freedom in art ideas because artist's mission on the Earth is provide and develop people's imagination, view on their life and belive. All countryes rules control express of creative people idea. 
For example, in North Korea geverment control, moreover forbit it as a result. Local population have same ideas, same lifestyle, same thinking. They do not have their own opinion, because afterwards it suppres gestures. Keeping in jail or killing. Of course it stop process of develop contry's social life. But in another contries give to much freedom for creative artists. In United states of America it is usuall thing to see person who drawing bildings stande pictures. Kinds have bad reaction they scared when see that and may be in future they will have problem with behive. Have problems in school, with relations with classmates and teacher. Kid see that have the same freedom and can do all what he want and no one can stop any actions. 
Goverment must give freedom to creative artists but have control. In many times their productes can have bad influence on peoples thinking. And as a result goverment must have low control.
