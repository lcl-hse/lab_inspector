The table illustrates information about the metro in several cities: London, Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, Koyoto, Los Angeles. 
Firstly, it's clear that London metropolitan was opened much earlier than other, and nowadays it's the biggest one (304 km of route). Secondly the table shows that Tokyo metro is much smaller and lower development than metro in London, but it takes 1927 millions passenger per year and this is because of in Tokyo population is much higher than in London . However in the same time Washington DC metro has particularly the same size with Tokyo metro, but there are not so much passengers, Tokyo metro is really over crowded. Koyoto metropolitan and Los Angeles don't have a lot of passengers per year, and it depends on not so very high population too. 
There is nor main trend - then more "ancient" underground railway system - then more are delopted it is, and has a lot of kilometres of route, and amount of passenger actually depend on citie's population.
