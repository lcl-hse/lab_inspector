Nowadays, education quality has been improved noticeably, serious problems with students behaviours are still happening. Let's observe the issue. 
To begin with, I would like to say that one reason is the education from student's families, their parents. Parents don't have a lot of free time, because they only work. To reach a fortune is value for parents nowadays. Also, two reason is a bad education at school. I believe, that a lots students dislike schools, because subjects don't interesting and typical. Also, pupils don't have pleasure of subjects, that also change of mood them and countries schools have severe problems with student behaviour. 
To continue the topic, I can say, that this problem with bad behaviour of pupils can solve. In my opinion, parents must spend make time with their children. Certainly, they must go for a walk together, visit some museums and communicate with daughter and son. As for me, my family spend time with me, talk with me. Also, more important, schools should know students, who are not well-behaved so as to reeducate them, preventing them from affecting other students. 
In conclusion, it is not only responsibility of families and schools but also the whole society to solve behavioral problems. In addition, those solutions mentioned above should be taken action before the problems becoming too bad to be fixed.
