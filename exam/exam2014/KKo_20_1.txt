The bar chart shows the time spent by the UK residents on different types of telephone calls between 1995 and 2002. 
Local-fixed line calls were the highest throughout the period, rising from 70 billion minutes in 1995 to just about 90 billion in 1999. After peaking 90 billion this year, these calls had fallen back to the 1995 figure by 2002. 
National and international fixed-line grew stadily from slightly less than 40 billion in 1995 to 70 billion at the end of the period. There was a dramatic increase from 3 to 50 billion minutes of mobile calls. The biggest rise was between 1999 and 2004. 
To sum up, although local-fixed lines were still the popular in 2004 as it was in 1995. The gap between the three categories had narrowed considerably over the second part of the selected period.
