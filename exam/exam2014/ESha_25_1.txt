The chart bellow compares the different levels of post school qualifications in terms of gender in Australia in 1999. 
First of all, as it can be seen on a chart, there were more women who had attended to undergraduate diploma and bachelor's degree in comparison to their male partners. Women as undergraduates had the maximum rate of 70% while men were about half of this rate and approximately 35%. On the second place, there were women's tendencies in Bachelor's degree around 55% where men's rate was a bit more than 45%. 
Secondly, it is show that skilled vocational diploma was the most popular degree among men 100% when females were counted as the minimum attendants in all of the post-school qualifications with one ninth of men (10%). Also, there were postgraduate diplomas with 70% - equivalent with undergraduate diploma in women - as females partners had decreased by 40%. The last one, Master's degree, had 60% advocates in men whereas this rate was 20% lower in women. 
Overall, it is obvious that women tended to be more educated in undergraduate diploma though men had more potential to aim for skilled vocational diploma.
