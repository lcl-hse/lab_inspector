Nowadays schools face with serious problems concerning behaviour. This is happening in many countries so it is essential to understand the causes of misbehaviour and find possible solutions to that issue. 
To begin with, this problem is very common, it doesn't have any national, local or cultural differences. So it should be considered as a psychological issue that deals with children behaviour. Let us look into causes that stimulate misbehaviour. 
First of all, it's boredom that students feel very often at school. Boring lessons trigger lack of attention and desire to enteract youself. That is why, some students start talking to each other, others make funny jokes and loud and even begin fighting. 
The second reason is that a school is a social institute with its structure and division. So some students are good at studying, whereas others are brilliant at sport. Strong students can bully weak ones. 
Certainly, there are some problems to mention too but we will focus particular on these two. In order to resolve the first problem, lessons should be more exciting and interesting. Teachers ought to motivate and encourage students. Regarding the second problem, it can be recommended to put emphasis on physical education at school so that weak students also get involved in sport and became stronger and stronger. 
To draw the conclusion, I can say that exist now can be easily resolved inside schools with the effort of teachers and school administration. So it's up to the school whether to try these methods or not.
