Many young adults now tend to take a gap year after finishing high school which is usually devoted to them getting some work experience or travelling around the world. This tendency usually has a positive impact on their career. 
Taking a gap year might be so advantageous for youngsters as they can make many useful contacts with people while working or simply travelling. That will undoubtedly widen their horizons for their professional future. Another benefit of taking one year off before going to University is an opportunity to get many soft-skills such as foreign language speaking or confident usage of computer which are very much valued by employers. It is also certainly an advantage that people who prefer to work for a year before studying at the University will be more experiences when finishing. As far as only travelling is concerned, young adults will get acquainted with many different cultures and mentalities that are spread all over the world. It gives them an opportunity to widen their horizons and keep an open mind throughout their lifes. 
Speaking about the disadvantages of taking a gap year, the only one that I see is loosing one year devoted to working or travelling instead of starting your Bachelor's degree studies earlier. 
All in all, in my point of view taking a gap year is a great opportunity to develop yourself as a person and to prepare some kind of "base" for your future career. It is a real school that will teach you to be responsible for yourself and your deeds.
