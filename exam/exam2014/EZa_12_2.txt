Through centuries problem of happiness has been becoming an object of thinking for many people philosophers, authors, poets. It is problem for every human being to define what happiness is it? Let uss discuss why happiness is important in life and what makes happiness possible. 
It is clear to millions of people to be happy. They think, that happiness make sense of life, its main aim. They don't have any other answers to the question: "What is the meaning of life", so they want to get happiness. However there is much more problem to define what exactly makes people happy. 
Definition of happiness depends on many different things. In some countries happiness means for this country's citizens something that is totally unlike our meaning of happiness. It depends on religion beliefs, culture, fractions, level of life, economic wellfare. Some people believe that human don't nned to be happy. This is can be explained by their's philisophical beliefs. For example buddist will say, that all our life is connected with suffering. Even things that make us happy can lead to suffering. Therefore people should deny from willings of happiness. 
It should be noted the famous phrase from "Paradox" novel by Vissarion Korolenko, Russian author: "Human is created for happiness, like a bird for flying, but not always the happiness is created for him". This words were claimed by one of the main heros of this novel He hands but he had big family, and he was the one who make money to make his family exist. For him absentt hands didn't make him unhappy. 
Overall some people can addict to suffers that make other people unhappy. And this addicted people can feel happy too. But for most people health, success, fame etc are important factors in achieving happiness. 
All in all, you can see that happiness is one of the main points in life.
