This graph shows information about amount of spent electricity per usual day during summer and winter, while pie chart contains data about 4 ways of spending it. 
According to graph we can make obvious conclusion that average English house takes almost twice more energy during winter compare to summer. We can see that amount of units of electricity spent during winter day has lowest point at 7:30 AM with 30000 units and highest point at 19:00 PM with almost 45000 units. But if we take a look at line which shows us amount of spent units during summer day, we'll see that highest point has only 20000 units at 1:30 PM and lowest point has about 13000 units at 9 AM accordingly. Meanwhile, judging by pie chart we can conclude that more than a half on energy they spend on heating rooms and water, another part includes three another ways of using electricity with same percentage (about 15%). It's lightning, small electric tools and ovens, kettles etc. 
As a results, we can say that average English house by obvious reason spend more electric energy during winter, but we can't compare a pie chart to graph because it shows only general trend, not separate information for summer and winter.
