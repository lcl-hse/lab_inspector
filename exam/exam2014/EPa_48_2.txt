The suggestion that number being gets worse and worse day to day is gaining popularity. Some people believe that the problem is in little sports activities. On the other hand; some people are sure that there are other strong factors which are expected to change our life in better way. From my perspective, not only sports facilities should be included in health-improving programmes. 
To begin with, sports activities are getting more and more popular. So, society is targeted at increasing the number of sports facilities. First of all, physical activities make people's bodies stronger, that is why organism can protect many illnesses. Secondly, sports is the way to relax your brain. It is an opportuhity to switch from everyday routine to more pleassure actions. 
However, there is a spread belief that sports is an ineffiecent way of getting healthier, more factors must be added. Firstly, people speak a lot about diets. Scientists persuade that a stamack is the center of our body; 70% of immune system are produced here. So, people need to be care about what they eat. Moreover, some people are disable to do sports. They are offered other different facilities of making their health better. They can do air gymnastic, they are sent to special health resorts, where the wealth of different procedures is presented. Furthermore, society needs to improve enviroment, because as it known most of illnesses are caused by surronding conditions. As I am a person, who wants to be healthier, I try to combine all factors in order to achieve higher results. 
By and large, as people's health is damaged by variaty of reasons, it must be threated from different sides.
