The question about number of students is very urgent today, because many people in some religious and autocratic counties think that the education must be only for men. However, other people in democratic countries are sure that the small quantity of women in universities is the changing of main democratical rules like equalty of all people. Many feminists says that the big number of men in some universities is the discrimination of women. I agree with them, but in my opinion not every university must have the equal number of women and men. 
I know that some universities or colledges has special specializations, which can connected with police or with building spaces equipment. I think that the only small percentage of girl wants to learn complicate things witch connected with math, engeneering, physics. It is clear, that women does not want to go in universities like these, because these kinds of profession are not interesting for girls. But it does not mean than men cannot to do it. 
Sometimes, the educational system contains some broaders for girls, because they are too weak in comparison with boys. All my friends think that boys must be strong and tall, whereas more girls prefer to be like careness butterflies. Unfortunately, many people think like my friends. 
Generally, I want to say, that all boys and girls must choose themselves what they want. In my opinion, because if the equal quantity of male and female in university was, it means, that our community would have many bad and unprofessional workers, because if you do not like to do anything, in many cases, you do it worse than if you like to do.
