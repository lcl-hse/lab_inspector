The problems connected to one's behaviour has been really important for a really long time. The society has softened a bit lately so the sanctions for bad behaviour are sometimes believed to be not as effective as they were. Schools are one of the places where such behaviour can actually be improved. 
First of all, we need to find out why some students behave themselves worse than others. There are several reasons for that. For example, the person has developed a bad character and so takes pleasure of making lives around close people hell. This is a severe case but a really possible one. The other reason comes straight from the previous one. It is the delusion of superiority. The students behaves bad because he thinks that he is better than anyone around, can do whatever he wants and no punishment will come. He could even not care about the punishment. The next reason may be the personal problems, usually connected with the family. When there are conflicts at home all the time, the child usually has two ways to go: to become this "bad guy" or lock all his emotions and feelings into himself becoming "heartless". So private problems have a really great impact on a person as well. 
But this problem can be solved. First of all, a good teacher will always try to calm down this student or even talk to him personally so that wouldn't affect his "position" in class. It sometimes works but not always. If this does not work a teacher should go to parents and explain the problem to them and try to persuade them to pay more attention to their child. There are also severe cases of the rebellion of the class against a "bad guy" but this happen really seldom, because they are usually afraid of him. 
To sum up, students' behaviour is a really important issue because it influences not only the person but also everybody around him, which is bad for education. So this should be taken more seriously by those who care most - parents and teachers.
