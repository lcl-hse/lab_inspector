Much has been written on the problem of pupil's attitude towards studying and teachers at school though it is still a controversial issue. I belive the reasons for that are not only in student behaviour, but in teachers' programs either and the both sides have no solve the problem. 
In my opinion, teachers do not do their job honestly today, because they rely on modern technologies and the Internet where pupils can find all the information they need. Thus, they forgot what proper teaching means and treat students in a wrong way. 
However, students also have to be blamed. Most of them believe that they are grown-up and know everything, because any information is available on the WWW. So, they do not do their homework properly and rely on reading the materials in class while the teachers ask them. Therefore, they do not understand the theme of the lesson properly, become anxious and cruel and forget all the rules of a polite conversation. 
The last reason to say is that no one today speaks on the topics about politness and intelligence which are very important. As a result, pupils today know a lot about the society and environmental problems, but their knowledge of simple rules of a polite attitude towards grown-up persons is very poor. 
Nevertheless, I belive there are some simple solutions to solve all these problems. Firstly, teachers should not rely just on the modern sources of information and spend more time on teaching the pupils, themselves. Secondly, parents have to pay more attention to the conditions and ways their child is growing up. Finally, there must be some classes devoted to the rules of behavior of students at school to ensure them that these rules are very important. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress that problems with student behavior are the results of parents' and teachers' mistakes. However, their cooperation to solve the problems will lead to the better results which they can imagine.
