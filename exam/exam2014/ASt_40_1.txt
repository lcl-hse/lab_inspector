The oldest railway sustenance from thouse in the list is the one which in London it was opened in 1863 and it is also the longest one, about 394 kilometres of route. The youngest one is in Los Angeles, it was opened in 2001. In the table also mentioned the late of passengers per year in each underground railway system. The highest rate of passengers per year is in Tokyo: about 1927 millions peoples on the 155 kilometres of route.

Then the huge gap, the Washington DC under ground system with 144 millions of passengers per year and quite long comparins to others 176 km route.
