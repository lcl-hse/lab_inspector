Nowadays behaviour of students is becoming a burning issue in several schools all over the world. School children neglect many school rules as well as miss a lot of classes. That is a tricky question why it happens and what can be done to improve this situation. 
There are several possible reasons for that problem. First of all, the main cause of bad behaviour is teenagers' nature. Children in difficult age are always supposed to protest against rules they do not conform to. There is nothing to do in order to improve that type of nature, but some changes can be done. As far as I am concerned, the most important thing is to give teenage students to develop culturally by giving them more lessons on arts, culture and so on. At the same time, teachers should understand what is needed for young people and respect their wish to show individuality, to set up their own rules and so on. That type of teachers' behaviour can lead to mutual understanding and improving situation. 
Secondly, one another reason for the problem of bad behaviour us that students are not involved in the process of education and not interested in getting new knowledge. That is a result of boring classes and the fact that children are not informed how they can use that knowledge. That is why students miss classes being sure they are unresourceful. The possible solution for it is to explain them why every course is important and what is the main purpose of it. For instance, as children understand the importance of knowing biology for future doctors, those who want to become a doctor learn it rarely. Moreover, teachers should make their lessons more interactive and capturing. These actions are to assure children not to miss classes and to encourage them to learn, which is likely to result in their behaviour. 
To sum up, I would like to add that some actions are able to be done to improve the situation of bad students' behaviour even if causes are difficult and lie in the very nature of young people.
