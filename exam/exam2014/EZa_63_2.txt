There have always existed different attitudes towards limits for artists set by government. Some people agree that there must not be any restrictions for creative artists while others hold the opinion that artists should be constrained. It is worth discussing wich opinion is better. 
As far as I am concerned, I agree with the second opinion that some artists without any bounds might be dangerous for society. That is why they should be limited by government. For example, some performances of famous painters are very provocative and shocking. Moreover, sometimes piece of arts seems to break the administrative law. They might be extremist or do not conform to the standards of the morality. What is more not all the artists ideas are worth to publish in words or films or anything else. Thus, to my mind, they should be filtered. 
Nevertheless, opponents of this view says that artists are suffered from restrictions. Firstly, because of this limits artist casn not always offer result of their work to public. Secondly, artist are thinking just about their frames anbd censorship so they loser their ideas while making plan hhow to avoid the punishment. 
Taking everything into account I can conclude that although limited art has some disadvantages they are completely are overweighted by advantages. So there should be a limits even for creative artists.
