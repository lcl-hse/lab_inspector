Sport is very important thing in our life, because it keeps us healthier. Governments of different countries try to increase level of health people, try to fight with smoking and alcohol. Also, we cannot forget that government increase the number of sports facilities, but there are some people, who think that it will have little effect on public health. So, we need to describe and inspect positive and negative sides. 
on the one hand, I agree with people, who think that it will have positive points. All of us have motivation to be the best in something, and sport gives us this chance. More and more people go to different sport sections when they see that different winners were simple people as they are. Sportmen motivate a lot of people to go to gym or sections to be healthier and stronger, to be the best, and not do it only for money, but for themselves. 
On the other side, there are a lot of people who think, that it is not possible and people will smoke and drink more than earlier. So, in my opinion these people do not try to do something in their life. They see only negative forms, they do not try do the best and find company or groups of people who think the same. 
In conclusion I want to say, that we need to do sport, because it helps us to live more and we need have healthy children who will also do different activities, Try to find yourself in different sport and be the best.
