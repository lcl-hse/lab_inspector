The problem of health care is one of the most important today. There are a lot of ways of sollution but government must understand the whole range of advantages and disadvantages wich are followed by every single step. One of the ways is increasing the number of sports facilities. Let's discus the effishency of this measure. 
First of all, increasing the number of sports facilities brings us more powerfull workers and studients which defenitely will increase the GDP of our country and marginal product if we speak about every single worker. The second reason is our future generations. It is not a secret that sport has a good influence on body structure and this measure will prevent a great nomber of deseases for us and our children. Thirdly, such step will take a child out of computer and video games which are destroy their health. 
On the other hand, such measure can bring us many bad things. If we speak about economy, we could not notice that there is a spending of a huge summs and other ways can be cheeper and more effective. Moreover, this measure do not cover the whole population an does not impact on adult which do not want to interact with sports facilities. 
On my humble opinion, such step could be good only with a complex of other healthcare measures. We must have a chang not only in our body but in our mind too. But the improving in that way is better than nothing.
