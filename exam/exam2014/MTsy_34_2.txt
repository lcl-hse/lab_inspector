In our world there are a lot of global problems and one of them is the worse public health. Someone believes that a good decision of this will be an increase of the amount of sports facilities, but others have another point of view. 
Anyway, a rise of sport centres, swimming pools, gems, etc. is a good way of solving this problem. First of all, it means that sport facilities will be near people's houses and consequantly they will not make spend too much time on just a road. Moreover, the huge number of fitness centres can impact on people's mind and help them to understand the importance of doing exercises. 
Nevertheless, an easy access to sport facilities cannot be the best variant in improving public health. Some people simply have not any desire to do sport and do not want to think about how it is useful. Besides, nowadays adults and expesially youngsters prefer spent their time playing computer games or chatting with friends in social networks and are not interesting in their helth. 
As for me, I am not strongly sure that the vast amount of sports facilities may ensure the improving of population health. In my opinion the first step must be a significant drop in production of junk food, because it is a reason of bad health in the last decades in almost all countries in the world. 
To sum up, I want to stress that the best way of improving health is a produsing less harmful food and creating better environmental facilities, not sports ones.
