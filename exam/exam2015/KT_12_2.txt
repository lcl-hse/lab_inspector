In modern world our life is demanding more and more different knowledge and skills from us so to set it children from early age go to some lessons and courses. Because of it they usually spend quite a little time outside and do not aware of all value and beauty of our nature, I can partly asree with this statement. 
From one side, it is true that nowdays children spent less time outside enjoying some simple things such as trees, grass, sun and fresh air. Even when they go for a walk, in big sities it is complicated to find place where virgin nature is saved. They have to walk around blocks of flats and roads where no fresh air or spectacular views are left, although they are very important. 
From other side, there is a lot of time children have to spend learning nature. They all have holidays when parents try to send they to different camps in forests or round the sea, to countryside where a lot of them have relatives or friends and so on. 
So in this time children have enough space and hours to learn more about nature, to learn to understand and appreciate it, to see how many it can give us and enjoy all of its advantages. 
To sum up, it is harder for children to spend a lot of time outside learning the nature now than it was before because of crazy life rhythm but there are quite a lot of possibilities to do it if they want.
