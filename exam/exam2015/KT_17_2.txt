Children's development has always been an pervasive issue. Nowadays children spend more and more time inside the buildings and rarely have a possibility to get in touch with natural world. But how essential is it to exposure childrent to the nature for their self-development. 
Undoubtedly, time spent in the nature is necessary element in children's life. First of all, it influence child's health in a good way and way hinder him from catching such deseasea as cold. Secondly, understanding and exploring nature expander child's mind. Unfortunately, nowadays for a great number of even talented childrent it would be a hard neet to crack to indicate a maple or an oak in the forest. Finally, while going for a walk children and teenagers have a golden opportunity to reach a harmony with nature, enjoy its beauty, relax, breath a fresh air and play some active games as football and hide-and-seek with their friends. 
On the other hand, it is not denying fact that so often children need to spend their time indoors. Not such facilities as Internet, TV, computers, books, playing video games can not be excluded from children's timetable. Not only do they get much of important knowledge indoors but they also can relax; escape from outside routine and enjoy the silence in their houses. Moreover, lessons in schools are also inside and it is admissible for childrent not to attend them. 
To sum up, the question is not straigh forward and way arouse mixed feelings. I strongly believe that the best solution is to make children spends their time in nature as much as possible to give them possibility to explore and appreciate the nature. However, it is also important to hold the balace between their time spent indoors and outdoors.
