Nowadays in lots of families both parents have a job and pay less time to their children. That is why kids have to stay home or in the kindergarden and their experience connected to nature is very poor. To my mind it is crucial for a child to have an exposure to the nature. 
Every human being must be close to the natural world because it leads to understanding that it is necessary to protect the lakes, prevent the deforestation and etc. for example, my litte sister likes to throw the garbage on the streets. I took her to the nearest park and showed two meadows: one was green and there were birds and another was grey and polluted with bottles and parks from food. Now my sister never throws any litter. But when a child stays home all the time he is unable to realise how important is to save the nature. 
Another reason why kids must be intergraded to the nature is that they can not feel the smell of a flower from a book and touch the cat on a photograph. Children must develop their knowledge about the world in order to be able to communicate with it. The best way is to see of all with your own eyes and to remember the sounds of water in the river. It was hard for me to memorise the names of flowers in a childhood before my teacher took me and my mates to the garden and showed them all. 
And the last cause why small children must get into the nature is that they should have something to remember when they get adult. The impression of a child is much more interesting that an impression was a bit worse. The person who tries all the best of life when he is adult gets less emotions for the rest of his life. 
Overall, I must say that the life of a child must be full of impressions and emotions which would stay in his memory forever. Childhood is the only period of time when a human being can learn the world around him and realise that he is a part of this world.
