There is a huge research area devoted to the studies of social and biological factors and their influence on individuals. From biological point of view, genes play the most important role in the process of formation of a person, while sociologists and psychologists believe that environment and life experience have greater influence than any genetic characteristics. I tend to support the sociologist's pointview, and below I am going to give arguments for that. 
To begin with, it worths mentioning that in the second half of the 20th century there was a great interest in this question and some important studies were conducted. Researchers found twins who were separated in their childhood and growned up in very different social environment. What did they found is that social factors such as some characteristics of neighbourhood, parent's jobs, and early life experience had greater influence on later life than any biological factors. Even though the difference in their impact wasn't considerable, it indicates that with equal set of genes people's future depends on their socialisation process. 
Looking deeper into process of socialisation, it could be stated that some "life shocks" in early childhood had a significant impact on person's personality. These life shocks include death of a relative, poverty, the lose of a house or bancropcy of a parent, and more others. After facing one or more of these circumstances, child might find herself or himself in a changing and unfamiliar environment. This, in turn, could provoke major changes in his or her personality. Since the nature of the "life shocks" is social and noone is secured from them, we can conclude that social component is very important to the process of the develompent of the individual. 
Therefore, I reckon that environment is more important then genes, since even slight change in it could be followed by a great change in one'a personality.
