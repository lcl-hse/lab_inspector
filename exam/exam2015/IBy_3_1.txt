The table summarises information on subway systems of six cities around the world. For each city three features are given: the length of railway, the number of passengers per year and the year the subway was opened. 
The oldest underground railway is in London, and it is the only one build in 19th century. While majority of subways in the world were opened during 20th century, the underground railway in Los Angeles started to function in 2001. The shortest railway is in Kyoto: it's length only eleven kilometres. At the same time, the longest route of railway is 394 kilometres for London's underground system. The most crowded subway is in Tokio. About 2000 millions people go through it annually. This number is far smaller for other cities. In both Kyoto and Los Angeles approximately 50 millions people use subway every year. 
Overall, underground systems differ a lot for given cities. It is true for such characteristic as length of route and anually number of passengers who use subway.
