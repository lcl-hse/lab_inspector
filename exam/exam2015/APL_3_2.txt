In the time of industrialization, less people are walking outside enjoing nature. Everybody is hurrying up at work, and after work - at home. And what about free time for walking? I absolutely agree with this statement, because nowadays there are too many advertisements inside. At the example computer and different gadjets, like smartphone, iPad and others. You can download on them hundreds of games, TV shows, films and enjoy them at home. All you need is only access in the Internet. in my childhood, computers doesn't exist in each family as nowadays. Because of this, we spend our time more interesting. After school we hurried up at home to do as faster as possible our homework. After completing the tasks, we input outside with my friends. We played different games. Also, we were walking through the whole city, climbing on trees and doing other amazing things. If you answer new generation about building houses on trees, they would admire, because they don't know anything about it. But video-games they can tell you for hours. Besides playing different games, we were walking in parks. I remember, how we collected insects and research them. In summer we were swimming in river and building costles from send. Winter, In conclusion, I want to say, that parents must learn to their children to appreciate nature. Because does not exist any one. It is unrepeatable.
