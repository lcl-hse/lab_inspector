Some sientists sure that our genetic characteristics are the main one and we can not change our character. Other believe that it is possible to change character by developing our minds and physical body. In my opinion, people easy could change by developing different sides of life. 
The simplest example when development breaks the nature is body changing. Some people say that it is impossible to keep fit because their genetic characteristics do not allow them to be skinny. It is not true because one boy from the USA brouke that "rule". His weight was about 250 kilograms and he started to do sports and keep on a diet. After a year and a half his weight was 89 kilograms! Everything is possible! 
Speaking about mind and personal characteristics everything is not so simple, but possible. The main thing is a desire! If somebody disided to change mind, he/she would do it. There are a lot of "helpers" like books, smart TVshows or radio programmes. Also, it is really exiting to take part in differend scientific projects. As an example I tell a story of my sister. At school she was really lazy and had only bad marks. After graduation she understood that her life is going to be really boring and useless, so she started to read books and interested in chemistry, now she is the best student at university. 
To sum it up, people could change and everything is in people's hands, the maing thing is desire and working, instead of your genetic characteristics. Personally I think that development is the right way to change yourself. Maybe some characteristics we are born with can not be changed, but it is possible.
