Nowadays world's rules make us to a really busy and high pace of life. But how does it tell on our children's way of life. Let me look thought it. 
Some people think, that modern children spend more time indoors, then playing on the streets. The reason is that nowadays the best toy for that children is their phones and their other gadgets.
