Some people think, that nowadays information technology and technical progress make children spend most of their time indoors, without knowing many things about the outdoor world. They believe, that it is essential for the youth to understand nature. 
It is clearly seen, that learning about nature is as important, as a good knowledge of computer science. New developments of science are making people's lifes better and easier. But without having an exposure to the natural world person can not be absolutely confident in its nearest future. Moreover, nowadays children can't survive in a brutal weather and climate conditions: they don't know what to do, if they are lost in the forest, how to live without Internet and games. On the other hand, of course it is valuable to know how to make programs and search for needed information. 
To my mind, digital generation should keep balance between natural knowledge and the informational one. Thus, children can be capable with both of this things, spending time not only for surfing the web, but also for tourism and expeditions. This kind of person has a lot of advantages. 
Firstly, this person has a huge exposure to the enviroment, that will help in a difficult situation if something goes wrong, for example, if humanity loose all technical achievements and developments after a disaster. 
Secondly, such kind of children will still be able to use it for different purposes, having a great understanding of how computer and other devices work. This will help humans to restore information lost after the situation in the first example. 
To sum up, both natural and technical part of human being play a grant role in everyday life, so it is vital for children to develop these parts of the universe well in order to become a balance person.
