Nobody can deny the fact that nowadays children do not spend much time outside and time at home, school and other buildings, so that is why they do not have any connection with the nature. However, it seems to me that one of the most important in bringing up children is to make them appreciate and love nature. 
First of all, when child stays most of his or her time at home or school he or she use new technologies like mobile phones, video games, TV and others, which are according to the scientists makes child very arrogant aggressive, while spending time outside makes him or her very calm and peaceful. What is more, according to the doctors, staying outdoor has a great influence on central nervous system. For example, my little brother has great problems with his neves, he get asleep very slowly, but when my mother stayed with him outside at the park he startes getting asleep very fast. 
Second of all, according to the teachers, children who stay most of their time outside at natural world are kinder as they notice the beauty of natural world, while children who stay at home playing computer games are quite angry and aggressive, so that is the reason why children should learn how to appreciate nature. For example, the main hero of the Leo Tolstoy's novel "Peace and war" Natalya Rostova is very kind and romantic. During the whole novel she has a great connection with the natural world and she notices the beauty where nobody notice it. 
To sum it up, I want to say that it is very sifnificat for children to spend their time at natural world as they should learn how to see the beauty and love nature
