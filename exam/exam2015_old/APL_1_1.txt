The chart describes the amount of houses from different urban areas in one European country in which Internet had already provided. As it may be seen on the graph, there is a significant tendency that urban households always had Internet access with more percentages than rural areas between 1999 and 2004. In 1999 houses from urban and suburban areas had already the access of Net and their percentage was approximately for about 15 per cent, whereas rural areas had only 3 per cent. Moreover, the opportunity of using Internet was increased sharply in urban ares from 1999. From 2000 their Internet access grew up constantly. Concerning the rural households, their opportunity to have Internet from 1999 was also rise but not so significantly. For instance, the amount of rural households owning the Internet was 50 per cent, while the percentage of urban houses with Internet was onlyn15 per cent. Overall, the chart shows that in urban areas the amount of houses with Internet is much bigger than in rural areas.
