The bar chart provides the information about the the proportion of city and rural areas in one country in Europe where there was an access to the Internet from years 1999 to 2004. 
It is clear that there are two upwards trends in the graph. The level of the Internet access in the urban and suburban areas. 
Only 15% of urban households had the Internet in 1999. In comparison, rural areas has approximately 2% over the some period. Between 2001 and 2002 the percentage of the Internet access went up by 10% (from 40% to 50% respectively). 
The highest level of the proportion of Internet access was in 2004 and it was about 55% in the urban area and about 35% in the rural area. 
It is also obvious that the proportion of Internet access in the urban households was much higher than in the rural ones. For example, in 2003 there were more than 50% of suburban areas with the Internet access and only 25% of the rural households. 
Overall, the percentage of the Internet access in all areas of one European country rose dramatically between 1994 and 2004.
