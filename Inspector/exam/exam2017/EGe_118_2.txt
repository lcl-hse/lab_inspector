Nowadays the rate of the young committing crimes became a big issue that should be discussed and solved. 
In my opinion, there can be a lot of reasons for such growth of the problem. First of all, in our busy world many parents sometimes tend to pay not as much attention to the nursery of their children as parents did before. The ideas of goodness, correct behavior and etc are often not explained to children well enough. Beside that, social media propaganda of different cruel or dangerous things being "cool" or "fun" also plays it's role. Young people very often cannot separate information on the one you should trust, and the one you should not. Also, supposedly, it could be because of the higher amount of stress which people receive nowadays in all age categories, or the eager of the young for adrenalin. 
What society really can do to help the problem is to promote correct values and inform people of what happens when you commit a crime. Parents and teachers should make sure that their kids and student are aware of the consequences, and should explain why it is so important to follow the rules and the law, and show good examples themselves. I believe that when given the right knowledge young people cannot grow up into criminals. 
Children are our future and their education in all spheres of life is very important for all of us, so we should definitely work hard to help each of them to become the best humans they can be.
