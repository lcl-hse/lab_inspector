The chart that is given in the task compares the way people were using Facebook in 2012 and 2013. The first part of the chart shows us that in March 2013 people started to use mobile devices more: almost 100 millions of users in comparison with only 55 millions in 2012. However, the number of people using desktop has decreased from 150 millions of users in 2012 to 135 millions in 2013. 
The second part of the chart illustrates the difference between the percentage of men and women using Facebook for the particular reason. It is clear that the same percentage (39%) of men and women answered that they were using this social network for receiving updates. The most dramatic difference was found in the percentage of men and women who use Facebook mainly for sharing photos/videos, the percentage of women is significantly higher: 54% in comparison with 39% of men. Overall, this graph demonstrates that women were using Facebook more active than men.
