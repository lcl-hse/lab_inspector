There is no secret that top sportsmen not only have training almost every day to achieve highest positions in competitions but also use different types of drugs. Despite the fact that most of them are allowed by world sport society and Internationals sports organizations, some of them remains illegal, and, unfortunately, this fact sometimes doesn't stop sportsmen and their coaches to use it. That's why some people believe that such sportsmen should be disqualified forever. However, others argue that temporary ban is suitable for such situatons. In this essay both of these points of view will be discussed. 
First group of people postulate that sportsmen must be banned for a long time, even forever. They explain his by the fact that sportsmen should not use any drugs to achieve goals and trainings is the only one variant. "If person cannot compete using honest way, why we should call him "sportsman"?", they claim. Besides, if sportsman was caught once there is no confidence that this situation will not repeat. 
Others tell that ban for a whole life is too strict measure. Prohibition for doing sports for a couple of years should charge sportsmen's mind, they think. Moreover this version says that there are a lot of anti doping systems and organizations, which rather correctly manage situation with illegal drugs. 
My opinion is close to the second variant, because I believe that most of sportsmen who have been caught after using illegal drugs did this for the last time. However, we should be strict in some way to such sportsmen and take away all their awards and trophies which have been taken in "doping" period. 
To conclude it should be noted that the are a lot of variants how to punish unhonest sportsmen, but we should do this using rational approach.
