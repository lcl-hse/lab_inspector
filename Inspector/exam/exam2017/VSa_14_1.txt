The pie charts show the percentages of goods transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. It could be seen that machinery and metals are mainly transported by trains rather than by road. 
First of all, food products account for 30% of goods transported by road, whilst by rail the figures is about 3 time smaller. Manufactured goods make up one fourth of total percentage in both cases. It worth noting that, machinery goods represent 2% of total transportation by road, whereas by rail machinery goods account for 12%. The amount of chemicals transported by road makes up 16%, that is 5% bigger, than in case of rail transportation. The segment of non-metalllic minerals transportation in the overall structure of road transportation is aproximmatly twice as big as in railway transportation structure. 
Taking everything into consideration, it could be concluded that, machinery and metals goods are predominant in rail transportation. In contrast food products, chemicals and non-metallic minerals make up the majority of road transportation.
