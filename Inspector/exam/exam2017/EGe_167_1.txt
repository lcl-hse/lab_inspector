The bar chart provides information about average time British people spent on doing sport and exercise in 2012. 
The most significant tendency is that people spend less time doing sport when they become older, for example, young men spend approximately 282 hours (two times more than women - it is the widest gap between genders) whereas men over 75 do sports just under 30 hours (women - 10). That leads to the second remarkable tendency that women spend less time on doing sport and exercises than men do. The most significant gap is between the youngest and the oldest while men and women between 25 and 74 do not show as much difference (less than 50% difference). 
A more detailed look reveals that there are some minor exceptions from general trends. The first one is men who are 55-64 years old do sports a bit less than women of the same age. In contrast to this fact, men of age 65-74 show an increase up to 60.5 hours and overcome women of their age. 
Overall, statictics of British people doing sports shows that men are generally more active in doing sports than women and average time spent on sport and exercises decreases while people become older.
