I will try to describe this situation from both sides. 
Firstly, I agree that this is a big problem in these industries. Let's start from fact that I'm a huge fan of music and cinema. Usually, I'm buying music on I-tunes, or in any other internet shop. And of course, usually I am going to the cinema, with mu friends, or with my girlfriend or maybe even solo. So It's normal for me to spend money for these kinds of entertainment. And I understand that my money are very important for musician and producers, But on the other hand, I have two examples. First - I have been known a lot of people, who is not able to spend money for this. It's people whose life is harder than mine in many ways, especially in financial possibilities. And I understand them extremely well, when they downloading 'illegal' copies of films in the Internet. And I have an example of my father. He is a musician, and I know very well, that outcome of public concerts in many times bigger, than a little percentage of disk sales, because the main part of it goes to producers. So I prefer to separate musicians and producers. And as my opinion, amount of money losing is highly overrated. Financially successful films always have a good outcome, despite of any factors. So problem is very overrated.
