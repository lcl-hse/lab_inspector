There are a lot of people think that technological progress leads to problems with health. 
Of course, some of innovations may decrease our health. For example, our vision becomes worse because of regular using of computers or phones, our ability to beat hear is damages by music in a big volume. But is it problems of modern technology? How can we influence on solving this problem? 
First, we should remember that we responsible for taking care of ourselves and we should control our habbits which can decrease our health. If we know that long-term using can lead to some problems, we should use it less even if we do not want to do it. Second, we should always read instructions from creators of technology in order to know all possible cases and the ways of their solving. Each technology has its own warning, so we always may get to know activities we should not or must not to do. Also, if it can decrease health, we will learn if from instruction. The third argument is we can switch to eco innocations. Most of them created with purpose not to damage the environment and not to decrease people's health. Technological progress allows us buy more and more safety things, which have no bad influence on people. We should focus on this area as investors, developers, creators or customers. 
Thus, technology may has bad influence on our health, but it is only our responsibility to control the number of influence. We should be solution oriented people if we want to stop it. Modern world gives us opportunity to make a right choise or create something new. So if we want to solve this problem, we will do it.
