In most countries people watch movies of American and British film industries, rather than movies of their own. 
The main reason for this should probably be, that USA and Great Britain are basically the countries where film industry was created, and so it has thrived and developed for a very long time there. But when the countries which didn't develop their industry try to simply copy the work and the methods of western movie giants, they are doomed to fail. Because making a work of such high quality demands one to be experienced. 
Of course, one can blame the governments for not funding their own film industry and giving local movies extra time in the theatres, which in their opinion is the only true reason for being worse than West. 
I certainly can't agree with such a position. First of all, my country does fund the movies, but as holds for any sort of funding, especially in the art, which movies are a kind of, one can't expect the final product to be great, if one invested their money unwisely. Which is exactly what happens in my country. It's actually a matter of finding good crew. As is apparent in my country all of the normal script writers seem to be doing something else. Because the main weakness of our movies is their scripts. It's actually even more bizarre considering all the money invested. 
As to sum up, maybe governments indeed should give more financial support to film industries, but they should certainly do so with great caution, as we have already seen the sad results of unwisely invested money.
