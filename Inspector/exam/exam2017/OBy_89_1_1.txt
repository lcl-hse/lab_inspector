So, we have a graph showing us unemployment rate n several world's regions. Graph takes data's changes between 2014 and 2015. 
First of all, I should notice that in this graph we can't see any global changes in world's problem of unemployment. We can see that percent of unemployers in North Africa, South Asia and overall the world remains stable. So there is no difference in world's unemployment rate between 2014 and 2015. 
Secondly, we can see a little fall of unemployment in Middle East. I'm not sure, but I think it depends on oil and gazoline money. Because the development of this industry gives people a lot of places for work. We can see the same fall of unemployment in Latin America, so Europe remains the only region with rising percentage of unemployment. It is simply understandable, because today in EU we have a huge demography crisis. 
Summarizing all these facts, I can conclude without fluctuations, that worldwide percentage of unemployment remain stable or allowable level. So as my opinion, the solution of this problem can't be a main goal of mankind nowadays.
