There is a tendency that people prefer American and British films to their local ones. There are some reasons for this, among them is lack of governmental financial support. 
There is a proverb in Latin "panem et circenses" that says people need food and shows - that is still true nowadays. British and especially American films are far more spectacular than any other movies (there is only one probable exeption - Indian Bolywood). For people it is much more interesting to watch some action movie with guns, cars and explosions like Fast and Furious. Fortunately, today we can find more films with deep meaning and ones that can be very inspiring, but general tendency shows that simple action movies are the most popular. They are so exciting due to expensive special effects, consequently, it is difficult to do it without money. 
Secondly, one can produce a good movie easier when there is a financial support from government. Genius directors and scenarists undoubtedly exist but they cannot do anything because of lack of money. Holywood is a stable financial system but, for instance, in Russia it is extremely hard to find a financial support for a non-standard movie even if you are famous like Renata Litvinova. Russian government give financial support but unfortunately this system doesn't work well yet. The key problem is the evaluation of quality of films to be supported. The government should probably give not more money, but to more valuable films instead of giving it to most famous directors with standard plots. 
Taking everything into account, it could be said that the key problems are tastes of people preferring expensive simple movies with much action and the government that should support really valuable local films instead of popular meaningless movies.
