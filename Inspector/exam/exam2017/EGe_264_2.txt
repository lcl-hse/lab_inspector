The style of our lives needs nowadays high speed in all areas. Transport is one of the most important parts of our everyday activity, it has been a necessity for many years. People have a habitat to use it unstopable. Personally I think that ecology needs more attention from people, and we should think about ways to deal with hafmful effects of such transport like airplanes. 
The air travels are not the only way to transfer. All other types of transport developed actively, so people have an opportunity to choose it. For example, high speed trains can go through long distance faster, then a few years earlier. Moreover, such type of transport often is more comfortable and safe, so people can feel calm and peace in it. People with mental illnes like phobies are already feel it. 
Society have to live in unit with nature. Ecological problems influence our planet, and we, as a huge part of its habitants, feel this effects. When we choose between our short comfort and the long term effects on nature, we need to think twice, because it is hard to fix problems like pollution and its results. The government should make the first step on this way to friendship with nature. 
In coclusion, it should be marked that health ecology is more important for us, then short comfort.
