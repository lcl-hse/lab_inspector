The chart below provides some information about unemployment between 2014 and 2015 in several regions. 
The first thing, which should be mentioned is that in some world regions unemployment rate has not changed at all. For example, in South Asia we can see the same numbers: 3,9 in 2014 and 3,9 in 2015. What is more, North Africa has the biggest unemployment rate, which was the same in 2014 and 2015. The numbers are 12,5 and 12,5. As we see, in a world wide we have the same situation. 
The one more thing, that cannot be ignored is some important changes in unemployment rate between 2014 and 2015. The first region, which has these changes is Middle East. Unemployment decreased from 11 to 9,6. The 11 number shows situation, which was in 2014, while 9,6 number provides information about 2015 year. We also have to tell a few words abaut Europe itself. The unemployment here increased from 7,5 to 7,9 (these two numbers show the same thing that previous ones). The last thing, which we must mension is the unemployment in Latin america. The rate decreased from 6,8 to 5,8, which is quite good example of goverment work. 
In conclution, we see that Africa and South Asia has stagnation in unemployment, but we can hope that numbers will decrease in a recent years.
