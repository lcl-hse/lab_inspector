The information given represents the highest and the lowest temperatures in every month in Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. The data are provided in average degree per month. 
It can be deduced from the graph that maximum temperatures in Brazil increase from 25 degrees above 0 in June and July to approximately 30 degrees above 0 in December and January. Minimum temperatures in Rio de Janeiro go down from near 25 degrees in February to the lowest 18 degrees above 0 in July. It can be noticed that the coldest month in this town is July and the warmest is February, because its minimum and maximum temperatures are the highest. 
In Russia the graphs of temperatures are more variable. The highest temperatures rise from 35 degrees below 0 in two winter months to 25 degrees in July. Temperature minimum declines from approximately 10 degrees above 0 in summer to near 41 degrees below 0 in winter. To conclude, the changes in temperature of the warmest month show two-time decline, at the same time temperature variaty in winter is not so noticable. 
To sum up, it needs to compare this two graphs. Average temperatures in Rio de Janeiro remain stable all over the year. In contrast, temperatures in Yakutsk change dramatically in different seasons. Differents between minimum and maximum temperatures are approximately 10 degrees in Brazil and go from 5 to 10 degrees in Russia in each month.
