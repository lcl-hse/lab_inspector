The graph shows us that the majority of young people, who are from 18 years old to 29 years old, use facebook. Also, it shows that the main audience of Instagram are young people. Four times more young people use Facebook, comparing with young people who use LinkedIn. Moreover, we can see that only 6 percent of elderly people use Instagram, which is 9 times less than the percentage of elderly people who use Facebook. There is an evidence that Facebook is more popular that LinkedIn among all age groups, but LinkedIn is more popular than Instagram by people who are older than 29. 
There are more people who are older than 65 and who use facebook than people who are older than 65 and who use Instagram or Linked in together. There is an evidence that the older someone is, the less likely he is using Facebook or instagram, but there are almost equal percentages of people who are 30-49 years old and people who are 50-64 years old who use LinkedIn.
