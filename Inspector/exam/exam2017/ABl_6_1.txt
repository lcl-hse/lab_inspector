The given bar chart shows the level of unemployed people in six selected regions of the world. The period which was revised includes two years: 2014 and 2015. The best result was shown in the Middle East. There the unemployment rate decreased for more than two percents. The main reason for these changes was the increase of migration flow. Young people of working age decided to travel to the EU to had jobs. At the same time the tendency of the European job market was becoming worse. Huge amounts of working migrants just could not be employed. This effect was caused by the dependent development of the world and globalization process. In Latin America government created more working places, which was included in the state programs of economic recovery. The economics of Brazil, for example was dramatically influenced by the world crises in 2008. The worldwide situation did not changed, during 2014-2015 period. Anyway the results cannot be seen just because of the researched period of two years.
