the provided charts demonstrate the goods transported by the rail and road between countries in Eastern Europe during 2008. 
As it can be seen from the charts, metals that are transported by the rail account for 35%, and this type of good is the biggest part of goods transported by the rail. In contrast, metals that are transported by the road account for only 11% that is less than transportation of metals by the rail three times. Manufactured goods are approximately the same both in transportation by the rail and transportation by the road and account for 25% and 28%. As it is shown on the charts, machinery constitutes 12% where it is transported by the rail, whereas machinery that is transported by the road constitutes only 2% and it is the most unsignificant good that is transported by the road. Transportation of food products by the rail account for 11% that is three times less than the food products that are transported by the road and account for 30%. As for chemicals, they account for 11% that is the same as food products; however, chemicals that are transported by the road account for 16% which are almost the same as transportation of chemicals by the rail. Transportation of non-metallic minerals by the road constitute 13% and they are twice bigger than non-metallic minerals which account for 6% and are transported by the rail. 
Overall, the most significant good that is transported by the rail is metal (35%), whereas in transportation by the road food products (30%) take the biggest place. On the contrary, the smallest part of transportation by the rail goes to non-metallic minerals (6%) and in transportation by the road the smallest part goes to machinery (2%).
