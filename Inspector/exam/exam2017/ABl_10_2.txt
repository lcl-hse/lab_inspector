Nowadays there are a lot of disputes over pros and cons of illegal music and music copying. Some people believe that all the content on the Internet should be free and avialible to everyone, while their opponents argue that illegal copying can be claimed as a theft or at least as a kind of crime. 
Actually, the opinion that pirate copying should be punished is really widespread around the world. People who support that position usually provide three main arguments. Firstly, illegal copying affects the amount of money that people of art earn every day. It reduse their income so people become less motivated to work at the sphere of arts. Secondly, it is bad for the governments economies because the illegal spreading of that content cannot be taxated. Thirdly, these illegal actions can undermine the moral side of modern societies. It means that nowadays some people start to think that something "illegal" can sometimes be a good (or normal) thing. It happens because people face illegal spreading almost every day what makes it normal for them, therefore the governments want to stop pirate copying immediatly. 
However, there is an opposite point of view on this issue. Some people think that every person in the world should be able to find all the content he or her needs for free. Advocates of this opinion say that some people just cannot afford buying films and music while they need it to increase their levels of culture and education. 
In my opinion, every work should be rewarded so it is not fair that film producers, actors and musicians loose some part of their money because of pirate copies. However, I believe that all the educational movies and pieces of art should be free as it is important for the level of culture worldwide.
