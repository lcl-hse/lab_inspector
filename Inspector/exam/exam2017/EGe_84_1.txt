The bar chart illustrates the number of adult users of social networking websites in the USA. The figures show the information on four different age groups of people on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.
As we can see from the graph, young adults, aged 18-29, are the prevailing group among Facebook users with 87 percent, while the percentage of others decreases with the growth of their age. Furthermore, 18-29 year old people make up the majority of Instagram users with 53 %, while people in their thirties-forties make up 25%, 50-64-year olds are 11 % and, finally, people aged 65 and more are the minority with 6%. 
The correlation of these age groups on LinkedIn is substantially different. The youngest and the oldest groups are on the same level of 22 percent, while people aged 30-49 and 50-64 are quite similar, with 31 and 30 percent respectively. 
Overall, the main trend is that people of 18-29 years of age are the prevailing group on more entertaining websites, such as Facebook and Instagram, while people aged 30 and more are interested in a work-related site LinkedIn.
