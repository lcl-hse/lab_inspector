Musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money every year from illegal pirate copies. Copying and sharing music or films on the internet is theft and people who download these files, instead of buying the original discs, should be punished. To what extent do you agree or disagree? 
First of all, in modern age of internet and technologies people have fun in many ways and the most popular way is sharing music and films on the internet. 
In the first place in this question should take into account the act, that many people can't afford to buy music or film. These people suppress their need with downloading and sharying films or music on the internet. These way, of course, is the most easy and comfortable. 
But if you look from the producers and musicians it brings huge loses. Imagine that you did a great job and in the end you did not receive suffycient payment for these work. In this situation, anyone would feel cheated because any work and job, especially creative must be paid. After all, the creativity and arts bring people pleasure and very good to relax. 
In the end, I am of the opinion that the films and music should be online, but it should not cost so much. Most often, the person comes to pay site and sees a large amount of licensed movie and thinks that the money he could to go and see that film at cinema. Therefore, I agree that online films and music can be pay, but they aren't be so expensive.
