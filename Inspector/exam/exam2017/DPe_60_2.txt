Today we live in the century, where the information is the most expensive thing, that we can have. All of our knowleges, all of our ideas - everything of it is information. It can be sound strange, but art is information too. Today technologies - our best friend and with their help we can do everything. 
Also we can find products of art in the Internet and download it in the only click. But not everybody think, that it's always good. 
Some people assume, that Internet - users must use only legal ways to find and take information - buy it on oficial sourses. They say, that creators of films and music lose huge amounts of money because of i-pirates and pirate copies. So, if we want to help people we like, we should give them some money for their works. That is their first argument. The second is that it's totally unfair, to use easy and cheap ways and use someone's work without fee. In addition, they think, that unfair people should be punished for their internet crimes. 
Another part of people use pirate copies and of course they don't want to be punished. They don't pay money because, at first, it's so expensive and not everybody can allow his to himself. Secondly, most things, that they download, don't have their author alive and they won't receive money. This money can take children or other people, who are unfair in this case too. 
As for me, I think, that I needn't pay for information I need, because it's the main sourse in our life. If I had more information, I can share and grow it, it's more useful for everybody. So I think, that we can solve this problem by lowing prices and having new rules of internet purchases.
