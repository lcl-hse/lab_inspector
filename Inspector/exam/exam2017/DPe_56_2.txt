Every day people download gigabytes of illegal pirate copies of music, movies, books in the internet. Movie makers and musitians lost billions of dollars because of it. That is why people are devided into two groups. First group supposes that every one can download music of films which he likes, instead of buying the original products. Other people think that downloading pirate content is some kind of steal, that is why it is illigal. 
From my point of view, second group of people is right, illegal copies downloading should be punished for the following reasons. 
First of all, film producers of musicians spend a lot of money and time to do movie of song. It is very difficult process, because they do something new, develop heir own ideas. There are a lot of examples, which show us that movie makers can invest hundred millons of dollars to make a good film. If people would not pay for the original content film producers will lost their money and they will not make new films. 
Secondly, a lot od pirate copies have very bad quality, that is why people cannot enjoy music or film as well as original copy. There are a lot of examples, when people watch pirate copy of film in very low quality and that is why they have wrong opinion about this product. 
From the other hand, some people dont have enough money to pay for the original content. In this situation people want to entertain themselves. 
This position is wrong, because in this case people can watch TV. 
In conclusion, all of us can understand that pirate copies downloading should be punished.
