Nowadays the latest survey has shown the trend among young people to committ crimes much more than ever before. 
The question is: what are the causes of this problem? 
To begin with, it needs to be said there are a lot of both direct and indirect reasons why youngsters do such things. First of all, this is about social stratification and distribution of wealth in society. In fact, there is a huge gap between the poor and the rich, and most of people in the world live in poverty. Consequently, there is no other way for such teenagers to make ends meet, but to become a criminal. In this case, it is up to the government to solve the problem on this level. Probably, they have to help them to find a job or get an education. Secondly, in some cases parents give their children either inappropriate nurture or do not care about them at all. The statistics shows that only 65% of parents are really aware of their child's life and help them to overcome some problems and hurdles. The solution is to explain young and adult parent that it it vital to communicate with children, bring them up properly and prepare for a real life. 
To put it in a nutshell, it is not possible to decrease committing crimes among young people immediately, but there are a lot of productive ways to do it.
