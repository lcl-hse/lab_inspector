The bar chart shows what share of people of different ages use Facebook, Instagram or LinkedIn.
As we can see, most younger people use Facebook. The bigger the age of a user, the less chances that he uses the Facebook social network. Facebook has much bigger audience than other networks shown on the bar chart. Looking on Instagram, we can see a sharp decline from 18 to 29 age group to 30 to 49 age group. As for LinkedIn, the share of each group is approximately the same. It rises from younger audience to the middle-aged audience and then declines to the older audience. Older people mostly use Facebook and almost don't use Instagram. Middle-aged people mostly use Facebook and have the highest share in the use of LinkedIn.
Taking everything into consideration, Facebook, being a social network for communication for all nessecities, is the most popular and mostly for young audience, while LinkedIn isn't as popular, but mostly used for professional nessecities, which means that middle-aged people are mostly interested in it.
