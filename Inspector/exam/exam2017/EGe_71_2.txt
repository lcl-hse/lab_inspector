Globalization makes us all to get more interested in multinational brands, however it causes that small local businesses are being replaced with large. 
I believe, that there are no really drawbacks, as our world is developing unstoppably. 
To start with, multinational brands are able to provide us with everything we need, so buyers do not really focuse on scrutinized choosing of product makers. Now you don't really pay attention while walking through the supermarket whether a product you've bouth is made by your local company or by a big famous brand. Secondly, multinational brands often produce products which are made with the world standarts, so you can be sure in consumption of good products. 
On the other hand, small local businesses are usually make cheaper goods. 
It is perfect for those who wants to save your money. In addition, small local businesses have a good effect on local economics. The recents statistics has shown that local economics consists of small local business on a third. 
To draw a conclusion, multinational brands become more and more priveleged and widespread, as people, especially modern generation tend to choose products made by large famous companies, replacing small local business on the second place.
