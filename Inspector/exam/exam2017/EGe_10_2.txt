Nowadays more crimes are being committed by young people than ever before. 
In modern world the problem of criminality among teenagers became sharp question and triggered a lot of discussions. In this essay I'd like to reflect different views on this problem from the point of its development and the solution of the problem. 
First of all, many people say that the reason of teenage criminality is the development of internet and technology, which allows youngsters buy guns and cold-weapons without any control. Moreover, the growth of popularity of violent content in TV-stream, movies and computer games make children copy vicious behavior and demonstrate aggression. As addition, children became more vulnerable before the face of anxiety and loneliness, which trigger a lot of problems with communication and the desire to be cruel and violent to people as a result. 
The question of how to prevent such behavior is raised on the governmental level nowadays, but teachers and parents should obviously take part in solving this problem. First of all, parents should spend more time with their children to know their interests and intentions. What is more, they should help children to move through their personal doubts, frustration and other psychological problems to low down the level of aggression. As for the teachers, they should solve the conflicts between students in peaceful way and conduct debates and team-building activities. Not only should adults teach children maths and grammar, they should also teach them how to be tolerant and keep calm. 
All in all, the problem of teenage criminality have its roots in the indifference of adults, who let the internet to be the best and the only friend of their kids. Every adult, no matter whether has he children or not, is to contribute in peace and stability of this world.
