It is time that we all use mobile phones and computers. Sometimes we can spend a day with this gajets, but it can produce problems with health. People who use phones or computers every day for a long time always have problems with their eyes. It can become with people, who watching TV all day too. 
The other health problem is about pollution on the streets in big cities. Cars, buses produce lot of smog and it can involve problems with health too. Clear air is very important for our organism and its dispear can make lot of health problems. That why people who have problems with health go to villages or places where there are no pollution, where air is clear.
