The bar chart illustrates the predictions about the print and eBook market in the USA, Germany, China and the UK in 2014 and in 2018. The main point is that in the USA the numbers are much higher than in all other three countries. 
Firstly, it must be mentioned that in 2014 the numbers of print was the biggest in all 4 countries, although the USA show the highest among all (10,5 billion dollars). The same situation will be in 2018 (the USA - 7,5, the UK - 2, Germany - 6, China - 4,2) even though there will be a decrease in numbers except Germany where there will be the stabilization. 
Second point which should be emphasized is that in all 4 countries the amount of money connected with the eBook market will also grow up. Here the USA will also present the first place. In Germany and China the numbers will increase on 0,5 billion dollars only (from 1 to 1,5 billion dollars in Germany and from 0,5 billion dollars to 1 billion in China). 
To summarize, it can be seen that the situation is predicted to be changed in four years but the tendency is going to stay relevant.
