Nowadays modern technologies became more and more invrving in our lives. There is an opinion about the increasing number of devices can be harmful for our health. It is important to agree with position written above. In fact, it is impossible to imagine modern life without technologies. They affect our lives enormously. Unfortunatly this influence is not always safe for our health, but there are different ways to come with these circumstances. One of the main provlems according to this conctraereral issue is eyes spoiling. It accures when someone uses such devices as mobile phone, computer, laptop or smartphone every day. Naturally, human eyes cannot deal with long and bright light affection, although such workers as, for example, programmers and designers spent all days in front of computer monitors. Due to this, they all (in most cases) used to wear glasses. Another problem is connected with physical appearance. Modern people (not all of them of course) have not enough time even to go for a wail and to do some sports. 
However, there is an another point of view. In contrast some people think, that technologies help us to be healthy. It is rather unbelievable, but it is also can be the truth. There are many technologies, which reduce difficulties with the health. For example fitness centers and medicine centers have an opportunity to make you a healthy person with the help of special equipment and well-prepared doctors. Overall, it is important to mention, that everything depends on a person, who is involved in using technologies. It is obvious, that they can be reduced by the right explutation of each device and by the good time management, which allows everyone to have good lives.
