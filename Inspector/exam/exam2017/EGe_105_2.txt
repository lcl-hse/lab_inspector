Nowadays people can face the unprecedented problem of the high level of crimes that are committed by the young people. 
To my mind, the main reason for such tendency is a freedom in Internet, where it is not very likely to find a censorship on most of the websites and also computer games. 
To overcome this parent s can restrict the accept for children to the Internet. First of all, parents can pay money for the specialist, who will install parents control on the computer, so children would not have any opportunity to visit webpages with specific content. The positive effect from this is that the level of children aggression would really decline, since they would not be able to see violence and crimes. However, there is no guarantee that they would not be able to watch it in their friend's house. 
Moreover, schools can try to make children to understand the consequences of bad behavior. The idea is that schools should organize special lessons, where teachers will tell children about the rules and morality of our society. Children are the ones, who perceive information very well, so they would grow up with the knowledge of etalon behavior. On the other hand, this method can be not successful, since there is possibility of making the situation worse by constant reminding how to live. 
All in all, I suppose, that the problem of youths crimes caused by violence is not going to be solved in nearly future because of the many aspects, though I think that the parents control is the most effective method today.
