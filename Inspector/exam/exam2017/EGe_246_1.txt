The graps illustrate maximum and minimum temperatires in Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro. There cityes are different in their temperatures, because they are based in differetn countries. 
As we see maximum temperatures in Brazil is 30 grades in January. In Rio de Janeiro temperatures not decrease and increase very quckly. Minimum they have in July and the number is 23. Another picture we can see in Russia. The maximum is in July and it is 25 grades. Minimumn is in January and it is -41 grades. Yakutsk very quckly changes his temperature. In winter rissians have - 40, but in summer 25. It is another situation in Brazil, brazilians have warm winter and summer, temperatures are quite high and identific. 
These countries are not similar and their winter and summer maximum and minimum grades are different. I think this fact will be interesting for tourists.
