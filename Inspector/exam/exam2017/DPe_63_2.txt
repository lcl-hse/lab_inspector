It's a well-known fact that all products from industry like music and film are easily illegal copied and transfered to the different website for free download, thus, producers lose enourmes amounts of money. Some people consider that it's not right and it must be punished. From my point of view I can't but agry with statements below, however, I have some reasons against them. 
As we all know that musicians and film producers can have success, when their product like songs, album, film or serials became popular and desirable. Nevertheless, one of their money resource is selling it all in public. In contrast, the Internet is a new service, where people can find all they want and absolutly free. For instance, we can look for all live concert from famous rock star on youtube and download all his song free instead of buying his albums in shops. Nobody will deny that a lot of pirate copies of just released films appeared almost after the first cinema shows it. To my mind I clearly understand that these actions are horrible for the musician and film industry. Also, I know that there are a lot of fans that like to collect all the original discs from their beloved interpretors. Although, I like the one of these illegal users consider that, when we have the easier way, why do not use it? Like an average man, who earns not so huge amount of money, I just do, what is in my possibilities. 
To conclude, I disagree with the action of copying and sharing music or films, however, I want not to refuse from this comfortable opsion.
