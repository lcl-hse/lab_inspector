It is true that space exploration is very popular nowadays, but it is also a very expensive field. Most people think that government should pay more attention on social problems rather then on building new space ships, while I am not agree with them. 
In my opinion, space exploration is not a waste of money. Firstly, scientists do a lot of research in the space. Thus, during such expeditions we can learn something new not only about different planets, but also about our own home. Secondly, it improves the way how we live. We would not have such common things today like television or the Internet without space exploration. In the near futur we might have something new that will be absolutely irreplaceble. 
Nevertheless, some people are quick to point out that trying to be the best in such field governments forget about real problems in their countries, for example, the level of life, crime, homeless people and other social problems. 
However, I believe that if the president, for example, decides that his country wants to be a part of space exploration teem, he understands how much it will cost and he will never spend money that are ment to be for social purposes. Otherwise, he can loose support of his people. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress that space exploration has its pros and cons. Personally, I think that it is a good idea to discover new planets and stars only ify ou have enough money for it.
