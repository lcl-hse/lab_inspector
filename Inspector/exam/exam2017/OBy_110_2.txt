Today films and music is the big part of the culture. We cannot imagen our lifes without listening to music while walking to the bus stop or watching film with friends on Saturday evening. But if we will pay all time when we are doing this normal things the cultural life becomes just for rich part of the world. 
At first, all of us knows that movies and music creators make money on the advertisment. For example in every film we can see some brend of clothes, marks of cars, or food like Twix, Orep e. t.c. If we will think on that side, then somebody still and share the film on the internet it is not a problem, because all people can see and the creator does not lose lots of money. Because the money is from the advertisment. 
Secondly, most music fans, if they like the group will buy the T-shorts or something like that with photos of favourite groups. That also helps making and saving money. 
At the conclusion I want to explicate that sharing something on the Internet does the matirial more popular and then it becomes importat for other people. From all that I have been written we can understand that illegal copies just help film and music makers become popular and famous. That gives them more money and profit.
