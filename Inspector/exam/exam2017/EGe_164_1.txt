The supplied graph represents data on the amount of time that was spent in England in 2012. The diagram compares the information about men and women aged from 16 to over 75. 
The most striking feature of the graph is the time that 16-24-years-old men spent on doing sport and exercises in 2012. The average time of this group reached approximately 300 minutes. At the same time women of this age group did sports rarely for more than twice. In comparison with young people, the older one spent from 10 to 30 minutes on doing exercises. It also needs to be noticed, that women overcame men only once: at the age of 55-64 women dedicated more time to sports than men. According to the graph, a huge gap between the amount of time spent doing sport exsisted only in the first group, while other groups were nearly equal. 
Overall, in 2012 English men spent far more time on exercises than women, except the group of 55-64-years-old women, who did their best and overcame men in the amount of sports time.
