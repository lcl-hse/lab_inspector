Nowadays people face up with different problems. One of them is that small local businesses are being replaced with large brands in many countries. This sutuation has some advantages and disadvantages, still I suppose that it is useful process for our society. 
Firstly, I believe that large companies can help our national economy. In cities near the large supermarkets different developed places are located. For example, near the malls we can find a lot of entertainments, interesting activities, restaurants and parks. Therefore I can Surely say that large shops are expected to improve the local area. 
The second advantage of large brands is the convinience for customers. From my point of view it is better to buy all the items in one place. People should not go to the different small shops and buy there two or three things, when they have the opportunity to go to the supermarket and find there the abundance of different things from different areas. Moreover it is cheaper for custumers, because they have no need to waste money on the road to different small shops and search there what they want to buy. Also people will save their time, which they can spend with their families, friends or they can spend it on doing their favourite hobbies. However, others suppose that the situation that small shops are being redundant now by large brends has some disandvantages. For example, people lose their small business and their jobs as well. It becomes difficult for them to find a new place for working, so they suffer from this . 
To conclude, I should say that every social problem has its own benifits and drawbacks, but we always should find positive sides. I believe that this situation has more advantages than disadvantages. Large brands are really more convinient for modern society than small shops.
