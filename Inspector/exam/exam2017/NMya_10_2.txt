Grow of amount of crimes commited by young people is a serious problem of our society. To find how we can solve this problem firstly we have to find the reasons of it. 
In my opinion first reason is gender equality nowadays the percentage of womens who has a job is higher than ever before, therefore they has less time for take care of their children. So children has more freedom than ever before. 
Another reason is the Internet. Nowadays majority of young people has free access to Internet. They can use it for find any kind of forbidden information, while their parent doesn't know about it.
