The graph below tells us about the popularity of 3 social networks among USA citizens dependent on their age. 
From the following data we can conclude that Facebook remains the most popular social net. More than a half of respondents in each age group use it. Moreover, in the age group "18-29" approximately 9 out of 10 people are Facebook users. 
Instagram is also quite popular among young audience. More than a half of young americans enjoy what the net offers. But success among older people is not that great. Only a quarter of respondents from the group "30-49" use the photo-sharing service, while people older than 65 barely use it. 
Regardless of difference in the amount of users, Facebook and Instagram share the common pattern of engagement dependent on age, which is "the younger the group, the larger the share of users" In contrast to that, LinkedIn demonstrates flatter distribution of engagement. We can't see any obvious coinsidences between the age of a group and the share of users. General conclusion to the graph might be that the leading network keeps its strong position by targeting the younger audience.
