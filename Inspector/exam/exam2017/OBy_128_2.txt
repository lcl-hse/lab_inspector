The problem of producing the food for own population, but without import - one of the most important now. A lot of people think that is burning issue. And politics try to solve this problem. I'll try to tell you my opinion as full as possible. 
On the one hand produce the food for own population and reduce level of import is really good idea. Because for every country is very impossible to be independent. And just think about own agricultural power. For example in USSR produced the quantity of food which this country gave population and export for the other countries. 
For the other hand not of the all countries has an opportunity to produce own food, because of clomat and geopolitics. In this situation helps modernization. And this country produce things, which this country can sell for the others countries. For example Europe and Unity of Euro countries. Each country produce the own product and sell it for the other countries like a Germany, France, Spain, Finland and etc. 
In conclusion I think that doesn't matter how government make level of the life, just matter which is this level. North Koreas is independent n the all sides, but the level of life is a low, but in Europe each country has own deal, produce own product - is not independent inside of trading with other countries. It is called madernization - it is nessesary thing in our life.
