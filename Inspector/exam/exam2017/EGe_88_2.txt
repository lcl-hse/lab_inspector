The crimes among the young have increased more than ever before. This may be caused by things like poverty, lack of education, physical and mental abuse, violent computer games, etc. This essay will discuss possible approaches for parents and teachers to be taken to solve this problem. 
Firstly, the responsibility of raising the young generation lies with their parents. Making sure that their child is not involved in violent or abusive activities is crucial in this case. Parents should monitor the types of computer games their children play. Knowing who their child is friends with is also necessary, because peers often shape each other's mindsets, which sometimes results in seemingly quiet kids being involved in bullying or any kind of activities that include violence. 
Secondly, since teachers are those who the children spend most of their days with, they are also participating in the forming of future generations. It is essential for teachers to crack down on anything that can provoke violence or be a cause of it inside the class. Becoming the child's friend and knowing their strengths and weaknesses would help them create a bond of love and respect, thus forming an individual that is law obeying and respectful to the other people. 
Finally, both the parents and the teachers are the main role models for children, thereby being a lawful and considerate individual in the eyes of the child is essential. 
In conclusion, it is the responsibility of the adults to solve the problem of growing rate of crime among young people. To be loving, caring and attentive to chidlren, to be a positive role model for them to look up to, are the best methods of solving this problem.
