The bar charts present the proportion between ethical groups of whites and non-whites in the United Kingdom and the United States of America in 2015. The population has been broken into two main types; general and prison. 
It is evident from the chart that the number of white citizens outnumbers those of non-whites in both the general and the prison population in the UK, whereas in the USA the part of non-whites staying in prison is approximately twice as large. It should be pointed out that the overall number of the non-white population in the USA makes up a notable part. It is worth mentioning that in the UK the non-white constituent of prison population is twofold bigger than that of the general population. 
Taking all the data into consideration, it can be noted that the non-white population in the USA seems to be prevalent, while in the UK the population mainly consists of whites.
