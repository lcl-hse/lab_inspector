I agree with the statement that nowadays more crimes are being commited by young people than ever before. In my opinion, there are a few causes of such problem. 
Firstly, I think that the society became more depraved nowadays, comparing with the past. It became cool to drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, use drugs - it is connected with a stereotype of wild and funny life, which is shown to young people in the Internet and TV shows. Young people aren't smart and wise enough to differentiate what is good and what is bad. They want to decide by themselves what life to live - that's why they don't listen to their parents and relatives, even if their advices are good and right. Secondly, nowadays there is an enormous pressure in lives of young men. They are asked to be good at school by their parents, then they try to enter the university, even if they have to take huge student loans. After the university there will be a job with mammoth working hours. Then, kids, family… Only after a retirement they might be happy! It is a long hard way. If a young man makes a mistake at one of these steps he may think that he lost everything and that he would never be successful. So, if there aren't incentives to be good, why can't he become bad? 
I think that in order to decrease the level of crimes commited by young men the whole teaching system should be changed. Schools and universities should shift from pressure and everlasting competition among students to giving them opportunities to explore the world and find themselves. Also, the society should change ideals that are dictated by the media - from money, superficial beauty, luxury life to love, kindness, truly happy life.
