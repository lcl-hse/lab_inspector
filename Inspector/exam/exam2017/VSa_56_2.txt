Today we all watch the TV and again and again listen about scandals which connected with drugs in sport. Somebody argues, that sportsmen who use this medicines should be punished by disqualification for a some period (half a year, for instance). However other side of people think that sportsmen should be banned forever from competitions. In this essay we try to consider both points of view and make some conclusions. 
First of all, sportsmen usually have not PhD in chemistry or medicine and they do not do on their own in all about diet, food and so on. This is their personal doctor's responsibility; it means that any illegal drugs became in sportsman's organism often through their doctor's actions or solutions. Consequently, WADA (organisation which struggles with drugs in sport) have to punish initially doctor, but not a sportsman. Furthermore, some sportsmen are young and if we disqualify them forever, his career will destroy and world lose new talent. So, the optimal decision is ban him for a short period it teaches him be more attentive. 
But on the other hand a thought punishment is ban for the rest of live) can make the situation with drugs declined. It is connected with fear about their careers in rest of sportsmen: if they see punishments of other people, they will try to not use any drugs. 
As for me, I suppose that ban for a limited period has more justice than ban for a limited period has more justice than disqualification for the rest of live. We can give to person chance to change himself, choose a new way in professional sport without any preparats that not allowed and he may understand that drugs not do not match with his career and that the crime does not pay. 
To conclude, drugs, specially in sport, are always wrong decision for people who want to live without any problems with life and professional success, have to reject from drugs in any form.
