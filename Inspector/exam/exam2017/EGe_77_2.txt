Today world presents as a great variety of hobbies and poeple can do almost any they like. One of the most popular hobbies is whatching sports. But can it beneficial of it is just a wasteof time. In this essey I would like to analise different effects of the hobby. 
Firstly, we can devide people in two groups: active fans and passive ones. The second group usually does spent too much time whatching sports, they do it almost on TV and don't significantly affect the society, while the first group,usually wathcing live sport events, can be really agressive. 
We can remeber many cases when the booing croud of fans ruined parts of cities and traumatized each other. So-called active fans can be called a problematic part of society. 
Nevertheless, there is an opposite oppinion, which claimes that fans can be socially-friendly and, what is more important, they help sport industry development,which makes nation more healty. This point of view is, whithout ane doubt, sensible. 
Still, we should take into account the fact that being sport fan doesn't mean being fit and healthy. The vast majority of fans dring alchogol and eat junk food. So, it can't be called a healthy lifestyle. 
To conclude,it can be noticed that watching sports can be useful for the personal health and national development, only if you don't neglect it.
