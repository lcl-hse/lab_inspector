In our contemporary world It is widely considered that watching different sport events or participating in diverse tournaments is a waste of time. 
In this essay, i will crack down on this issue and discuss both the potential drawbacks and advantages of such activities. 
To begin with, it is fair to mention that according to some recent statistics the vast majority of adults and teenagers spend long hours watching football, tennis, swimming or other sport events instead of perfoming their duties which include far more complicated tasks than lying on the sofa. Furthermore, it is not a secret that our young generation is a truly lazy one, so up-to-date children would rather watch sport games on Tv than being engaged themselves. 
On the other hand, i cannot but agree that for those who contemplate a career in sport live sports events can help to acquire new knowledge and improve some weak points. 
Besides, it should be mentioned that a lot of families get united when sitting together in front of a Tv and having heated debates on a particular sports topic. In addtion, i want to admit that national sports ocassions translated by means of Tv have an objective to trigger some patriotic feelings. 
In conclusion, it must be emphasized that despite some negative effects watching sport games can provide people with, it cannot be attributed to any kind of senseless activities.
