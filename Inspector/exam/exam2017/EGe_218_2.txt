Nowadays traveling for work ar business puposes bacame a signifacant par of people's lifes. Few would despute the fact that travelling by plane is the most conviniet way to get to another place, although it produces an outstanding amount of gases. Whether the government should make any steps in order to decrease the number of air travel is a controversial topic worth discussing. 
On one side, many people are of the opinoin that the government itself should step in and provide us with some law, which would reduce the amount of air travel. To begin with, it would be better for everyone to have a legal, strict directions about, how and when one person can fly, as it would make an impact on greenhouse gases and global warming. In addition, it would not confuse anyone or create arguments about, who's turn it is to take a flight, because people could just see the legitimate document, providing them with needed information. Moreover, this law could be useful for government could as well, since it would have a better control over the income of the all airline companies. 
On the other side, there is the view that the laws that the government would introduce might not help the contemporary situation. Firstly, these laws would interfeare with people's personal life, thus causing arguments and controvercies. Secondly, government might overtake the whole air traveling sector and organise a monopoly on air travel. And thirdly, so far there is no possible way that kind of law could be introduced properly and accepted by the public. 
In conclusion, it is obvious that air travelling laws is a very provocative topic. But personally, I believe that some laws that would have and effect on the decrease of polition are needed. Therefore, I would advice for the government to make airline companies turn to natural resources and use environmentalfriendly fuel.
