Every year the percentage of crimes commited by young people grows. Compared to previous periods today it has reached unseen before level. Why this is happening in our instantly developing world? And how we can deal with that problem? This is what this essay is about. 
It is obvious, the main cause is careless parents. Nowadays some of them believe that modern technologies (like Internet) and teachers in schools can substitute them in explaining to a kid what is good and what is bad. However that is not true. Children need intant guidance in our world and if parents think lessons in school are enough, then there will be a lack of knowledge about crimes consequences. The situation becomes even worse when a child become a witness of committing a crime at home, i.e. home violence. 
It seems, rooms for improvement here are pretty clear. First of all, we need to make parents really caring about their children. This is the only way we can fill the blanks in the youngs' understanding the fact that violence and crime are strongly unacceptable. For example, government can strenghten parents' responsibility for their kid's behaviour by arresting them. Second, teachers in schools can start a course about crimes where would be explained about consequences of commiting a crime and how to deal with problems in legal ways. 
To conclude, I believe the main reason why modern society faces extremely high rates of the young's crimes compared to other years is growed parents inability to take care of their children due to technology and school overpricing. To reduce that rate, I would recommend to encourage parents to teach their kids using government measures and to add a new course about crimes into school learning plan.
