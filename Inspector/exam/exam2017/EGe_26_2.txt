Nowadays there is a tendency in business field that large companies eradicate the small ones. Advantages and minuses of this trend will be described below. 
To begin with, the main plus of well-known companies is stability. 
People often tend to safety, so they need to know the ingredients of food they eat, the label of goods they consume, etc. Therefore, multinational brands always have a popularity with customers, because they offer the same level of goods' quality all over the world. That is why men trust large companies. 
Moreover, it should be said that it is easier to create advertisments fot the chain of stores, because it will be recognisable and bright. If you have a monopoly on market, it will be much more beneficial for you to succed and earn money. 
On the other hand, there is a huge drawback in process of replacing small companies by large ones. Not everyone is born is rich family and has a heritage of thriving business. If ordinal person would like to start out a carier due to his own deal, he needs space for development. However, he cannot succed, until some huge popular chains exist. People are not able to struggle with each other, if they have different backgrounds for businesses. Therefore, small companies need to tackle large ones. 
All things considered, despite of the prominent disadvantage of this development, benefits are more important. People have reliable businesses, which supply customers with good service and owners with money and job.
