In our days there appears a growing problem of antisocial and dangerous behaviour among young people. To my mind, this issue needs a thorough look and a serious tackle. In this essay, I will outline several reasons for this behaviour and suggest some possible solutions which can be taken. 
To begin with, the problem is related to the lack of parents' control over their children, because they are often very busy with their work and cannot look after their children. What is more, during the development of the Internet, bigger amount of dangerous and violent information spreads by it. More young people nowadays have access to the global net so they see this cruelty and it influences their minds. 
As for the solutions, teachers, for example, can organize additional lessons for those kids, whose parents are busy at work. They can also organize excursions, trips to the cinemas and theatres and other interesting activities. Parents, in their turn, should spend enough time to look after their children and be more attentive to their thoughts, mood and behaviour. Of course, it is their responsibility to give their children love and bring them up properly. Also they should put special filtres on home computers which avoid dangerous cites with an inappropriate content. 
In conclusion, I can say that if the above mentionned solutions are implemented, the number of crimes committed by young people will decrease. It is very urgent issue and it is our responsibility to tackle it for the sake of our children and security of our society.
