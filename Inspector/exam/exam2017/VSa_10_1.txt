The 2 given piecharts illustrate the percentage of transported goods of different types by road and by rail. Overall, it can be seen, that the share of manufactured goods, that are delivered both by trains and by trucks, is practically the same. 
However, there is a certain difference between the amount of the producement shipped by the 2 means of transport. For instance, metals contain more than a third in a whole delivered goods by rail, whereas it's share in road transportation is thrice less. To continue with, the pattern is reversed for the delivery of food by these 2 means of transport. For example, the amount of grocery, transported by the road, is thrice as high, as transported by rail. One more noticable feature of these diagrams is that the share of chemicals, shipped by both means of transport varies from 10 to 20 per cent. 
On the whole, the lowest share of both graphs belongs to the transportation of machinery by the railroad, containing only 2%.
