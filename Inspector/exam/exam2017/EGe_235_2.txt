There are different opinions about crime reducing. Some people think that the best way is doing prison sentences longer. But on the other hand, there are a lot of people, who do not think that it is a good way. They have some other ideas. 
So, we have two opinions here. The first thought is a little strange. Nowadays we have a lot of very comfortable and cool prisons. There people have a good meals, rooms, libraries. They can do sports in gyms and so on. It is very popular type of prisons in European countries. So, I do not think that the longer prison sentences is the best way for crime reducing. 
Maybe in some other prisons, for example, in Russia this way is better, but not is the modern prisons. In the Internet there are some photos from Sweden prison. It is something like hotel. So strange. 
But there are the other opinion about this problem. Some people give other alternative ways of reducing crime. For example, some works which are useful for other people or maybe some creative and interesting works. For example, they can collect useful rubbish and create some interesting things. The other way of reducing crime is using free psychologists. The can speak whith people who have some proplems. For example, a person have not enough money and he do not know, what to do. He can do a mistake. But on the other hand, he can speak wich professional helper. I think that it is the best way of redusing some little crimes. But it cannot stop a serious murder. 
Finally, there are a lot of loyal ways of reducing crime and I think that they can save a lot of people.
