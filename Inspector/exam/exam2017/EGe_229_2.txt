We are all humans and we are facing the same issues. We want out society to flourish. Nobody wants to be killed, mug or so on... So, hardy anyone will deny the fact that reducing crime is very important. But, what should people do to minimalised the crimes statictics? 
Some of us believe that only the long prison sentences could fight the crime. They also think that killing prisoners for the hard issues those have made isn't a crime itself. MOre than this there are a certain amount of people wishing some of the prisoners to be killed. In the counties like muslim ones and in the some of the Amirican states it isn't a big deal and such thing happens quite often. But it does not goes along with the principle's of correct law. 
And in Europe such kind of things are prohibited as for residents and citizencs of the country and so for law institutes. The great exsample of minimalising the crime and judging thiths and killers properly is Sweden. There are the most comfortable prisons in the whole world. They look like a special cities with small houses where the prisoners live and work. The prisoners themselves are around to visit the city very the normal people live and shop there. 
NEvertheless, we can imagine the same in Russia. Prison is a very expensive institute to run. So we can put all of the prisoners in special settlent or even the simple, awful builings our country alreade have, so the new approches to reducing the crime should appeared. 
Maybe we should think about anti-unemployed politic, free education for everyone. 
Thus, things can get better and there will be no crime.
