Illegal drugs in sport is one of most struggled problems nowadays. Some people believe that consequence of using drugs by sportsmen should be denying participance of that athlet for limited period. While another part of people claim that punishment should be stricker - banning for the rest of their lives. This essay will demonstrate two different points of view. 
Athletes should be given a punishment - 2 years without any competitons. People, that support that point of view, highlight situations when sportsmen didn't know that he used illegal drugs: for example, because of new rules or his doctor was not aware of essential information and gave illegal medicines. Another reason is that everyone, including sportsmen, has a chance for mistake and if sporstmes was punished, banned for some period of time, he would not try to do it again. 
Although the majority claims that the althetes should be banned for 2 years, there is a group of people with contrary point of view. Sport is very fair part of live and using illegal drugs influence rules of sport. Moreover, that illegal medicines give more chances to win for participants from developed countries because they can provide their athletes contemporary drugs by modern techologies while developing countries cannot afford it because of lack of money and qualificated scholars. Furthermore, they believe that if sportman uses illegal drugs he broke rules of world sports community and could not be its member again. 
Hence, I believe that if the athlet use drugs first time, he should be banned for 2 years but if more than once, he should be punished by banning for the rest of their lives. To sum up, that topic is very discussive nowadays and opponents are arguing till today.
