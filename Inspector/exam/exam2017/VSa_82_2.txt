Nowadays the increasing appliance of illegal drugs in sport is an acute problem. Two ways of overcoming this problem are offered. The first wag is the limited term ban for the sportsmen using illegal drugs. Another way is the ban of such sportsmen for the rest of their lives. This essay will discuss both points of view and then offer a variant of solution. 
Regarding the first opinion, there is a strong arguement to support it. A large number of famous sportsmen whose name is brand (e.g. Usain Bolt) need to use drugs for good results in large scale competitions. To give these sportsmen a ban for the rest of their lives means to deprive the companies using their names (e.g. clothes producers) from their incomes. An arguement against this point of view is that commercialisation of sport is itself an issue to struggle with. 
As for the second opinion, it has a strong arguement to support, like the previous one. This is the way to prevent sport from further commercialisation. However, as mentioned, today sport is an unique source of incomes for plenty of companies. It is certainly the case that if sport becomes less commercial, many employees of these companies will be left without work places. 
To conclude, it seems impossible for me to find a viable solution of the problem under discussion.
