Lets consider an issue, that nowadays more crimes are being committed by young people than ever before; think of reasons for that and possible solutions to the problem. 
The main reason for that can be spread of Internet and similar technologies, development of virtual reality where things are less controlled than in the real world. 
Firstly, we should notice, that nowadays young people have access to much larger amounts of information than ever before. That results in fact, that they can easily get lot of know-how of committing crimes and, moreover, can be influenced by criminals, who wants to achieve their own purposes by doing dirty thing with someone's other hands. It became easier for young people to get in the "wrong" companies, to contact criminals and be influenced by some stories and promices of better life. Real examples can be found in different groups in Vkontakte, where criminal HRs are working. 
Consequently, we should mention another reason for that - lack, or inadequate amount of control. Government, public services are still unfamiliar with internet, it is often uneasy for old people to learn how to use it in full potential. Examples of it are in families too - children usually know much more about computer then their parents. The last can physically control, if their son is at home at night, but miss many connections that he makes in internet and expecially in social networks. 
As a summary, I would like to offer several solutions to that problem - parents should care more about social activity of their child in internet and most of all - about his contacts there. If he chats with strange 40 years old man - that's a bad signal. If he visits restricted forums via TOR - that is a very bad signal too. Police should also pay more attention to what is happening in the Internet - many crimes, if not all, have their roots there.
