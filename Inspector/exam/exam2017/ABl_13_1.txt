The bar chart shows levels of unemployment in the whole world and in some particular regions, as Northern Africa, Middle East, European Union, Latin America and Southern Asia. 
First of all, we should notice, that worldwide level of unemployment in 2015 remained on the same stage as it was in 2014 - 5,9%. However, this does not mean, that nothing has changed. (Nothing has changed only in Northern Africa and S.Asia). 
The worldwide unemployment percentage is the same due to decrease of it in one regions and increase in the others. For instance, there is slight grouth of unemployment rate in EW from 7,5% to 7,9%. On the contrary, in the Middle East and Latin America there are serious decline in this rate - from 11% to 9,6% and 6,8% to 5,8%, accordingly. 
Despite the fact, that in 2 regions there are decrease of unemployment levels and increase in another one. The worldwide level is the same, as it was mentioned above. This could happen because of overpopulation of the region of Southern Asia, therefore it can affect the rate in a significant way.
