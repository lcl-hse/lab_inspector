The figure presents the distribution of three social network users among online adults by age group. 
We can see that Facebook is the most popular social network among all age groups (more than 55% users for each group). Moreover, 87% of adults aged 18-29 use Facebook. 
For both Facebook and Instagram there is a tendency to have more young users (87% vs 56% for Facebook; 53% vs 6% for Instagram). Nevertheless, LinkedIn is oriented on middle-age people 30-64 at about 30%. Instagram is the least popular social network for all age groups except for 18-29 (less than 25% each). 
All in all, younger people tend to use social networks much more than older. However, such developed networks as Facebook count more than 65% of adults on average.
