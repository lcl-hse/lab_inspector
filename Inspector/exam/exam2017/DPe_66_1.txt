In Africa unemployment reached its peak of 12,5 and remained steady until 2015, but the same cannot be said about the situation in the Middle East, where unemployment rate decline over the period. In Europe only 7,5 people were unemployed and their amount had increase slightly by 2015. In Latin America there was moderate decrease of unemployment from 6,8% to 5,8 over the year. In Asia there is a steady low amount of unemployed peoply, only 3,9% by 2015, and it is rather better than situation in North Africa where percentages of unemployed people is remarkably high. Situation in Asia is also better than in the Middle East, where we see steady high level of unemployment, nevertheless there is modest decrease of it. 
In conclusion, the worldwide level of unemployment is steady rather high. But graph shows that all over the world (instead of Africa) the level of unemployment is declining slightly or it is steady and not very high. So, we may hope, that by 2020 there will be extremly low level of unemployment. I mean, it could reach its lowest point.
