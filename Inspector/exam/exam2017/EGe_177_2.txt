One of the main topics of last century was space exploration. Many great discoveries were made, but are they so great that they mean more than unsolved issues on Earth? I tend to agree with the opinion that money spent on space exploration can be more useful on Earth. 
First of all, poverty is still a very big issue in lots of countries. There a still places where average income is about 15 dollars a month, whereas one spaceship start (not always a fortunate one) costs billions of dollars. 
There are many other problems in the world which can be solved with money. For example, some enviromental issues, such as pollution. In China this is a very big problem. There are a lot of cities with more than a million of people, this means that there are huge numbers of cars on a small territory. This led to constant smoge on the streets which led to that almost every citizen has problems with their lungs. Although, there are solutions. For example, Singapoore builds high-tech systems to grow as many plants on their territory as they can. This is a city which is also a country, there are not much space, so they decided to use rooftops, balconies, even walls as places where trees and other oxygen makers can grow. 
On the other hand, space exploration gives us knowledge of some fundamental laws which will help to live a better life. Some people even say that someday everyone will just leave this planet and everything will get better. As for myself, I prefer not to think what will be after myself but think about higher quality life.
