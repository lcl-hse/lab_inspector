Today young people commit crimes more often than they did years ago. There are a few reasons for that. In this essay I will try to give causes of this tandency and solution that people who are around youngsters chould use to make sure that this trend will stop developing. 
Firstly, nowadays almost all teenagers use social networks that are full of violance and cruelty. There are a lot of people in the internet who try to bring children to illigal groups who make crimes every day. Young people are very sensitive and easily manapulated which leads to them joining these groups. What is more, news that are shown in television, unfourtunatly, can be an example for children that are have, maybe, some mental problems. These kind of reports could potentially be the reason why teenagers can have thoughts and ideas of committing some sort of crime. Moreover, children have computer games that are often very cruel and teenagers learn from them about violance. 
Nevertheless, there are always ways to prevent or even solve this problem. Parents, for instance, can garde their children from social media till certain age. It is possible that teens without it won't even have an idea how to commit a crime. Another approach to this problem is for teachers in schools and, if it is neccessary, in universities create a subject from which teenagers will learn that violance is never a solution for any problem, that everything can be talked out. 
To sum up, it is true that young people make a lot more crimes than before because of social networking sites that were invented or bad examples in real life,however, we can prevent it and make sure that children are safe.
