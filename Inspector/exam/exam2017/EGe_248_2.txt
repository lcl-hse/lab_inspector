Nowadays it is hardly to imagine journeys without plains. There are some reasons why plains are the most comfortable transport. But instead this, people should to think about that the air travel is problem of air pollution and global warming. And sometimes people should found allternative decisions. 
First and the main reason is economy of time. You can spend more time if you use bus or train to go somewhere. Second reason that modern plains are very comfortable and you enjoy when you use it. Third reason, sometimes in buses and trains are dirty, but in plains are always clear. 
Summarize all these reasons, people prefer to use plains more than another transport. Very often they do not think about air pollution and global warming, when they buy tickets to the plane. But it does not change the situation, and this is also the big problem. 
In my opinion goverments should introduse laws, when air travels between near cities and countries are not needfull. People can use plains when they have long air travel. For example, to go from Moscow to Saint Petersburg people can use bus, train or sapsan exept plain. I think such travelling helps to reduse air pollution and global warming. 
In conclusion, goverments cannot reduce all plains travelling, because the most people already cannot imagine their lifes without plaining. But goverment can reduce the plainig between near cities, wheen the time of travelling makes up no more than 10 hours.
