There is an idea that air travel can cause air pollution and global warming, so some people claim that it is necessary to create the law which would reduce the number of flights for any purpose. 
To begin with, it is worh saying that any vehical can damage the nature (not only plants and animals but also the Humanity): air planes produce special gazes which pollute the atmosphere (moreover, it is unnecessary to say, that every plane crush can kill several cube kilometers the live beings). What is more, all this time the government closes its eyes when this question rises but if it create a special law and control the situation, everything can dramatically change; the amount of flights will be minimised and the nature will be saved (but some international companies will lose lots and lots of money (and a lot of people will be hired)). 
On the other hand, it sounds strange: the law which is made for the reducing air flights. That is why I see another solvation: the only way to improve this situation is to creat a grant for scientists (of all the countries). So they would invent the new type of planes which would be "pollution free" and its using would not cause any climat problems. However, there is a long way because it should be done in all the countries (including small ones where the cheep and old versions of flying vehicles are used (because they pollute more then others)): so all people should unite to provide our grandchildren with fresh and clean air, with the possibility to see white bears and penguins (which would not extinct because of global warming) etc. 
All in all, the wisest way to solve the problem with environment (caused by air planes) is to modernise all the flying vehicles in the World (however it is the longest and the most expensive but at the same time the most effective way).
