Nowadays the the importanceof the ethnic background in the percentage of prisineers is hotly discussed. The chart compares the percentage of white and non-white populations in the USA and in the UK. 
There are some remarkable tendencies and differences between the two countries. Let me analize the charts. 
First of all,it can be claimed that in both countries the vast majority of population is white, although in the USA the percentage of non-white does not differ sharply from the percentage of white people. 
Secondly,while comparing the two countries, we can notice a significant difference in the ethnic bacground of the prison population. In the UK percentage of white prison population is significantly higher, while the USA percentage of white prison population is almost two times lower. 
To conclude, it can be said that the connection berween the proportion of white and non-white general population is not the same as that proportion in prison population.
