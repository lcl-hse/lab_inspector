The bar chart illustrates the difference in time spent on exercise by men and women of different age living in England. 
In all age categories men spent more time doing sports than women. The most significant difference is between young adults. Women from 16 to 24 dedicate around 115 minutes of their time to exercises, while men do sports for almost 300 minutes, which is twice more. However, numbers start to differentiate less with people getting older. Men and women spent almost same amount of time on exercising as they reach 55 years old. Although after 64 men start to exercise more again, but the difference doesn't reach big numbers and stays less than 20 minutes. Graph also demostrates how age affects the amount of sport activities people do. After 75 years old men do approximately 10 times less exercises than theyy used to do at the age of 16. Same tendency is observed in women's sportlife. Amount of time spent on sport falls from 115 to 10 minutes. 
Overall, the chart shows that amount of time spent on sport activities done by people when they are still young adults is almost 10 times bigger than they are 75 or older. Age also influences the difference between time men and women spent on exercising, it becomes smaller as people get old.
