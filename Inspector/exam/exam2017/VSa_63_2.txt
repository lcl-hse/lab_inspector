The usage of permitted drugs in professional sport is a very important problem in the modern world as the medicine is becoming more and more developed. 
One people consider, that athlets who used illigal drugs should not be punished very strictly. They are proving that every person can make a mistake and one chance should be given to everybody. Moreover, there is not very good tendency in professional sport: political relationships between countries last few years have begun to effect to the dicisions in sports. 
Moving to the other point of view, which says that athles, who broke the rulles, should be banned from competing professionally for the rest of their life, it should be mention some points. Firstly, it is just not honest. Secondly, the person, who was able to behaive not tryly once, could do it again. Hence, there are some examples: Ekaterina Yourieva competed in biathol broke rules twice. 
To sum up, I should underline, that this promlem is very important, and I consider that an athlet who has broken rules ones should be banned from professional sport for the rest of his career.
