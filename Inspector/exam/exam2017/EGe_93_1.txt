The graph provided illustrates the changes of population in the USA throughout two hundred fifty years. 
The first thing that should be mentioned is the fact that the number of people reached its peak in 2000 so it's it the most striking difference. Furthermore, according to the graph it can be seen that the birth rate in early 1750s was quite low, and the situation remained the same up until 1800. Concerning this period it can be assumed that the country was undergoing some dramatic changes so that the death rate was high which prevented the growth of population. However, the tendency started to change: the number of people grew gradually during further 150 years. Finally, the number of Americans escalated sharply in the second half of the 20th century, which can be explained by the sudden sharp rise of birth rate. 
Summing up, the population of the USA has been increasing steadily throughout the history and reached the number of 300 million people in the beginning of 21 century.
