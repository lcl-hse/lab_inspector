Many people like listening music, watching movies and nowdays there are a lor of varietis how to download it and always people do it for free but it becomes a big issue for people, who produced this product. 
Firstly, I'd like to say that with event of 21st century - Internet our life makes more easy, because everything you want to know, every music you want to hear, every movie you need to see - all of this we can found un different sites and download these for free. Let's consider the advantage and disadvantage og this problem. The cous of it is that we haven't need to spend a lot of money for movies, music. You can download many albums of your favorite groups, watching huge qualities of movie and haven't pay attention of your money. By the other hand, it's not right for people, who made this, because they send huge money, their times to produce it and for them it's job. I think is unfair for them. 
A big period of time in Russia there are was a lot of pirate copies. Teenagers could download their loweliest music from difference sociealy like VK or some web sites like torrent and musician and producers losed enormous money on it. 
Finally, I think that people have to pay for their downloads.
