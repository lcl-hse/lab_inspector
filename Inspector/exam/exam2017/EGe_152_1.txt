The represented bar chart presents the main tendencies of the book market in such contries as the USA, Germany, China and the UK for printed editions and eBook market in 2014 and how it could be developed in 4 years. 
The main trend that can be observed is that the amount of money spent on various kinds of books in the USA strikingly outnumbered the money that was squandered in other countries. It can be clearly seen that that USA residents preferred to buy paper editions instead of eBooks - there was two times as much money spent on paper books than on electronic ones. Whereas, the forecast shows that just in 4 years the situation will change dramatically - paper editions will lose their popularity and have only 7,5 billion of dollars, whereas it will be a craze about Ebooks and they will outweigh paper's by one billion of dollars. 
There is also one more trend that can be distinguished - in comaprison to the USA, UK residents spent less money on any kinds of books. To be more precise, it was spent about 2.6 and 1.8 billion of dollars on printed books and eBooks respectively. Moreover, in the future these numbers will remain quite stable. In detail, the amount of money squandered on these two types of books will be nearly equally represented - 2 billions of dollars versus 2.3 billions. 
Taking all the mentioned into consideration, Americans spend the most amont of money on both printed editions and Ebooks, though the distribution between will be different in 4 years, while in the UK these numbers will be quite steady.
