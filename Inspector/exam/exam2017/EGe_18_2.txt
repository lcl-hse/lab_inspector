Crime is a common thing nowadays. People's homes are robbed, many women get mugged. These kinds of things are certainly not happening without a cause. Economical crisises, wars, politcal conflicts. All of them make people turn into criminals, even the youngest ones. The crime rates amongst young adults is getting higher and higher each single day. But why does it happen? 
Well, one good reason for that is certainly different types of conflicts or happenings, which affect people on a global scale. If we remeber the fall of the Soviet Union for instance, we can certainly recall a lot of stories about different gangs and notorius criminals, which ravaged the country. Back then It was hard to support yourself and crime was the only way out even for teenagers. Secondly, It can certainly be different psychological factors such as peer pressure. Youngsters can be certainly persuaded to take part in criminal activity If the offer is alluring. 
All the information above sounds horrible, but what can we do about this? There's no precise answer out there,because every young man or woman has his or hers reasons for commiting crimes. The only good thing that parents and teachers can do, is to cultivate strong will in then and try to teach them critical thinking, so they would understand how doing "bad" things may affect the society and the country they are living in. But even my methods are a topic for a very huge debate. Times change and people too, so It's hard to tell if there will ever be a perfect solution.
