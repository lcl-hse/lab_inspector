In our generations, the unfairy usage of illegal drugs by professionally athletes is becoming more widespread, than in the XX century. There is dispute between people about punishment for these sportsmens, who used it. Some argue that there must be ban for them for a limited period, however, other think that ban should be for the rest of their lives. I agree with opinion, which is connected with limited period of ban, however, I will discuss both position in this essay. 
Firstly, it is correctly to say that all professionally athletes have such a great responsible for all of their actions, and all of these actions have a reactions. For example, for illegal action must be reaction from athletes association, however, all happens should be analazing in the individual way, because all of people are unique. Nonetheless, some may argue that all act must be punished equaly, but they don not think about uniqal causes of this usage of illegal drugs by someone. 
Secondly, all professional athletes are connected their life with their kind of sport, and their trainings. For example, somebody trainings about 25 years and has only one mistake in life, then illegal drugs were used. Some people may argue that it is cause for the ban for the rest of life. however they don not think about all traumas, time or power, which are connected with this athlet. I think that this kind of punishment for once time usage of illegal drugs is very cruel. 
In conclusion, the spread of the usage of illegal drugs by sportsmens is very important problem nowadays. People have various opinions about punishment for these athletes, somebody think that it must be limited and other think that it must be ban for the rest of life. I think that all cases are uniqal and there can be different period of bans, however, it must be harder for twice or more time using.
