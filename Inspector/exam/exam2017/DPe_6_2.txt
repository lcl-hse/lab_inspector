The Internet has a special power on musicians and film-makers. Nowadays the technology allows to steal their product, which means stealing money, so easily that almost any user can do it. It is a crime and pirates should be legally prosecuted. 
It was made possible to exchange information freely and in great amounts. To produce this information costs a lot of effort and money for creative people. A usual worker is paid for creating the product, so it would be fair if musicians and producers of films could be as much as they deserve. Because of sharing files on the Internet they lose bigger money than ever: many people prefer enjoying free films at home rather than paying for original records or going to the cinema. Taking pirate copies is a theft, and it should not be left this way. 
Another argument is from a side of moral hazardness. A free-riding has always a problem for many generations. But in the past it was simpler to control free-riders: sharing something implied a real-life contact. Now a virtual reality gives a broad space for possibilities not to buy something and use it without being punished. Music or films copied and shared on the Internet with one user and another makes it feel like ideas should not be paid at all. Such type of philosophy can exterminate any incentive to create something beautiful and share it. 
Making pirate copies leads to huge money loss in current time, so it should be prohibited and punished. Giving free music and fims constantly forms a free-rider problem and certain beliefs, that can become moral hazards in the future.
