In recent years, most politicians begin to suggest the system of guaranteed basic income. It is considered to give any citizen of the country sum of money each month. What is more, other incomes will plus to yours in total. Although, this system seems to be rather beneficial, it is still have some disadvantages. And it is important to realize the facts which may outweigh them. 
Firstly, it is undeniable that the level of life will boom up, because most citizens will get a chance to live better. These opportunities, which open behind most people, will benefit the economy of every country from one hand. 
Secondly, as far as I consider, the level of education will grow up. And as a consequence of it, there will be more educated people, which will study all spheres of life properly. 
However, a "Guaranteed Basic Income" system needs a lot of money, which government will take from the budget. As a result, we have a lot of risks that the economy will go done immediately. It is important to understand the basis of work of our basic economic system and take into account that the balance is much better variant for the country itself. 
In conclusion, it is obvious that the system of guaranteed basic income has a majority of advantages for people's level of life but still it doesn't outweigh the disadvantages it has because of risks. From my point of view it is much better for people when government will give new work places for any person in the country. This will run the economy up and benefit it.
