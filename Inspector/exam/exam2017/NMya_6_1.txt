The graph depicts the percentage of adult users of different social networks in several age groups in USA. 
There is an obvious similarity between histograms for facebook and Instagram: the older users are the smaller percentage of users of social network of their age group is. That is not true for LinkedIn: this social network is the most popular for users aged 30-64 and less popular among young and old people. 
Another clearly visible tendency cannot be ignored: Facebook seems to be the most popular social network for online adult users from all age groups. However it is hard to tell which social network is the least popular: there are significant differences in preferences of the groups. People of age 18-29 are the most active users of social networks and this group prefers instagram to LinkedIn, but nevertheless, it cannot be said from the graph that LinkedIn is less popular among all users than instagram.
