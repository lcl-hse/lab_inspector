The same situation is within the women. At the age of 16 to 24 they spent 114,1 minutes doing activities, while at the ahe over 75 women spent just 10 minutes doing sport during the whole year.

To continue, the chart shows that men at the age of 25 to 34 spent more time doing sport than men at age of 35 to 44. The difference is almost 20 minutes during the year.
