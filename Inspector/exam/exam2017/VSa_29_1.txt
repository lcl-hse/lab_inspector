Interestingly, transportation of 'manufactured goods' is approximately the same both by road and by rail, 28 and 25 per cent respectively. It is noteworth, that transportation of 'chemicals' and 'food products' is absolutely equal by rail, about evelen per cent. What is more, transportation of 'machinery' is significantly lower by road than by rail, 2 and 12 per cent respectively. 
To conclude, there is a remarkable difference between the goods' range transported by rail and by road.
