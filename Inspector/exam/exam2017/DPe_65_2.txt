Each day brings us new emotions and new feelings. This fact is also suitable for the modern audio and video spheres. New types of music and films are appearing even while I'm writing this essay. As a result there are lots of materials to be bought, but people don't want to spend money for it. They prefer just to download illegal pirat copies and watch or listen everything at home. Let's think about should they be punished or not. 
Be honest, I'm a person, who never buys official materials in shops. That's why I totally disagree with the point about punishments. First of all, people, who download music or films from the net don't want to pay a lot of money for it in brand shops. That happens becouse of products' price. It's extremly huge and can really hurt your budget. 
To prove my point of view I ask you to imagine the following situation. You came to the media shop and you eyes couldn't see all of films presented there. So, what would you choose. How would youd decide what to buy? Would you take a film, which cost 800 roubles or even more? Well, let's imagine, that you bought one. Then you came home and couldn't wait to see a perfect film! But… You turned it on and in the first the minutes you understand thit it was awful. What were your emotions? Talking about myself, I would feel sorry about wasting my time and my money. To prevent such situations I prefer to watch films online and then, if I liked it, I would go to the shop and buy it. 
And what about people, who doesn't have an opportunito to listen to music or watch film at all? He doesn't have any money for it. Does it mean that they should forget about media sphere. A guess no. And pirat copies is the solution. 
To conclude everything I want to say that copying and sharing music or films through the internet isn't a theft. This just a way to be common and to have the same opportunities as other people have. That's why I think that downloading illegal copies shouldn't been punished.
