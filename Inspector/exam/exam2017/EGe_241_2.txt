Air travel has been considered to affect increasingly the ecological air state and boosted the greenhouse effect. Nevertheless, this essay disagrees that a lot of air flights are a waste of time and therefore governments are to restrict constitutionally the percentage of air travel for business and leisure. The first paragraph will discuss the essential role of air tourism and the second one will explain why laws are useless. 
To begin with, most business and leisure air travel contributes to the economical state of the governments. The budget of the majority of hot countries depends on the tourism rates and the amount of people visting their country annually. For example, the southern european countries, such as Bulgaria and Greece, rely on the industries providing a wide range of service to tourists, comming round annually. The more the amount of visiters will be, the higher the government will earn. 
Moreover, a lot of modernised air companies already meet ecological regulations, introducing eco-friendly designs, prohibiting overbooking and regularly rising costs in the most favourable tourism seasons. 
In conclusion, there are some people who support air travel restriction, yet I believe that it will have a detrimental effect on the economicies of tourism countries and stop the development of the air travel industry on a global scale.
