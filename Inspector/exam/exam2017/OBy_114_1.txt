The chart below shows the information about people who do not have work in selected worl regions in years 2014 and 2015. 
The worst region of unemployment is North Africa. The level of unemployment remain the same (12,5%) in both 2014 and 2015 years. The other countries, where the unemployment rate remain the same were S. Asia and other countries Worldwide, that were not in this chart. The lowest level of unemployment was in S. Asia (3,9%). However, it also stabilized during these two years. In Middle East in 2014 the level of unemployment reached 11% and then in 2015 decreased to 9,6%. The only country, where the unemployment rate grew was EU. In 2014 it was 7,5% and then it rose to 7,9% in 2015. In Latin America in 2014 the level of unemployment grew to 5,8%, shoeing one of the best results in this chart. 
To sum up, I would like to say that the situation of unemployment worldwide in 2014 and 2015 remained practically the same. Only few countries showed better results in 2015, compared to the previous year.
