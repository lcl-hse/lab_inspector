Some politicians have come up with an idea to create a "Guaranteed Basic Income" system due to which a citizen gets a fixed sum of money monthly regardless of another his or her income that has been already established. A person may doubt and question the assumption whether the advantages outweigh the backwards. To give my own opinion I would like to consider this issue providing some arguments for and against the project. 
To begin with, In case the system is not overseen and prepared profoundly, it may lead to severe consequences. It is necessary to create a particular part of country's budget from which people will be paid. As a result, the government has to reduce or even discontinue the financial support for some important spheres of life such as military or poor population support. To prevent this, the government should raise taxes which are not likely to be approved by people. 
On the other hand, receiving a guaranteed sum of money every month enables to have lots of opportunities. Indeed, for most fractions of the society this system can become a good support and base in some struggling situations in life that are common nowadays. For example, because of economic problems a person gets fired from job but still has his or her fixed income which will probably allow them to start up or at least live normally until they find a proper job. In conclusion, having considered this subject and both advantages and disadvantages, I believe that the benefits of such a system will outweigh the backwards as it is a perfect social support program.
