The bar chart illustrates the proportion of using three social networks: Facebook,Instagram and Linkedln. As it is clear from the graph all three networks have become most popular among people of 18-49 years old. Users who are over 50 visit such websites less frequently. 
We can notice a major tendency looking at this chart. The distribution of age groups is very different among Facebook and Instagram users compared to Linkedln ones. In the first two cases the younger people are, the more popular Facebook and Instagram among them are. The situation with Linkedln is not the same. The age group 30-49 is prelevent here. 
However, the usage of each network has its own particular features. For example, there are huge differences between age groups of Instagram users. The proportion of the first age group is about a half whereas the following age group is only a quater. 
To sum up, young generation prefer communication via the Internet more often than elderly people. Yet is differs depending on the network they use.
