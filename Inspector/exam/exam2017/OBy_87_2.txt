Copying, sharing and downloading pirate copies of films or music is a controversial issue nowadays, It is theft and people who do that should be punished because of musicians and film producers who lose great amounts of money every year. I am completely agree that people who download such files should be punished, but there are some advantages and disadvantages of this situation which I will discuss in this essay. 
For the one hand, pirate copies allow poor people who have no opportunity to buy original discs to download and to enjoy music or films. For some people it is the only chance to know cinema trends and popular musicians. They have no way in that situation and no possible solutions. 
For the other hand, it is a complete break of author's rules. In this case such theft should be punished by tax. Futhermore, there is another problem of pirate copies. People who download copies are risking to catch a virus on their computer or tablet. It is definitely a big problem and a cause why pirate copies should be prohibited. One more disadvantage of sharing pirate copy is losing money by producers and creators of music or films. 
There are advantages and disadvantages of using pirate copies. Moreover, it is a theft, but it seems to me that it should be punished by tax instead of strong punishment. Also musicians and film producers can create mote copies of their discs, for example, and try to solve it with the lowest price. It can be one of the possible solution in that situation.
