It cannot be denied that nowadays big international companies replace the vast majority of local businesses. Some people think that it is better to them, because now they can buy products that are popular in more developed countries with same quality and prise, but some peolpe claim that this process kills the industry of other countries, because the folks have no place to work and they just become unemployed. 
On the one hand, big brands really know how to deal with production, how to build big works and make a lot of products at short time period. It is also bettter for countries in which those works are located, because many locals can find a job for themself. Moreover, it is easy to control quality in big company, so you don need to create many different comissions. China can represent the example of country that was lucky. At the end of the 10 century big American brands came to the China with money and built a lot of works to product literally everything. People got jobs and become to work. Sellaries was very small, work was hard, but now China has one of the biggest industrt basement that works very nice and bring them a lot of benefits. 
But on the other hand, is looks not so nice in countries without big works. 
People are not able to find a job. Local businesses cannot race with international brands, so the have two unpleasant ways - to become a part of big brand and send them the biigest part of the money or leave the market. 
For example, Poland's industry was killed by the international brands. They used to have own independend market with huge amount of jobs and normal amound products, but now they have plenty of goods and literally no money to buy something, because all those products are made in China. 
To sum up, big international brands can rocket some country's industry and totally destroy enother's. So it is really hard to find out if it is advantage or disadvantage, but enyway it should be controlled and controlled wery well.
