The diagram below gives us some information about unemployment rate changes. The presented information concerns a few word regions and two years - 2014 and 2015. As we may observe, the highest unemployment levels are in North Africa (12,5%) and the lowest are in South Asia (3,9). These paraments have not changed during the year, in other regions, however, they did change insignificantly. So, the European Union is the only region where unemployment rate has raised over the year and changed from 7,5 to 7,9. In the other two regions with the rate changes presented - Middle East and Latin America this numerical indicator fell from 11 to 9,6 and 6,8 to 5,8 consequently. The overall world rate stayed stable with the value of 5,9 during 2014-2015. 
So, to summarise the information and to depict the results of the 2015: South Asia has stable and low rates of unemployment, EU and Latin America rates are almost the same and fluctuate a little. The Middle East rate is rather high, but tends to fall, and North Africa has the highes but stable unemployment rate.
