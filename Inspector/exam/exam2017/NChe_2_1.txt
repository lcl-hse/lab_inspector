The diagrams show the amout on goods transported by rail and by road. Due to chart, transported by rail, the biggest part goes to metals, while in other chart this part is one of the lowest. Morever, countries in Eastern Europe prefer to transport manufactured goods by rail as like as by road. These parts in procent are simply tha same. As it is very difficult to transport cars by cars, there are only 2% of machinery goods transported by road. On the other hand, 12% of machinery goods transported by rail. Eastern Europe find it better to transport food products by road. In both chrts the amount of chemicals is very low, about 11% and 16%. 
To sum up, I consider that Eastern Europe prefer to transport huge equipment by rail, when there is also an opportunity to transport not very large things by road.
