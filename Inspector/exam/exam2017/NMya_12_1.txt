Nowadays social media are one of the most important parts of our life. For instance, social media tends to be used as strong marketing channel. However, each social network has its own target audience. Therefore, social networks may be separated by their audience into two groups. 
The first group consists of widespread social networks such as Facebook. The target audience of these networks is relatively young: Facebook, for example, has covered 87% of young people and only 56% of elderly people aged 65+. Actually, the target audience of Instagram is even younger: 53% of young people covered against 6% of people over 65 years old. 
On the other hand, there is an other group of social media. It consists of professional networks, the most well-known is LinkedIn. The distribution of users differs a lot from usual popular networks: it covers equal part of young (18-29) and elderly people (65+) - 22%. 
In my opinion, such an information is quite important for many professionals, especially for PR departments. 
Knowledge of the target audience will help to choose right social network for advertising something. However, I'm pretty sure, it's not the only way, when such an information is useful.
