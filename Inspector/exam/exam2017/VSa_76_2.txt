According to researchers using of illegal drugs is widespread now. There are two different points of view: sportsmen should not be allowed to do any sport about 2 years or athletes must not participate in various competitions for the whole their lives. Both points of view are aceptable and now we are going to discuss them. 
First of all, there are too many sport scandals and the major part of them are conected with illegal drugs. International organisations try to overcome them and the basic method is banneding atheletes for 2 years. It is believed that after this period they will be free and clear and will not any aftermaths. Eventually sportsmen can continue their careers. 
On the other hand, influention of drugs are spoiled health and competitions for sportsmen after drugs-scandle are unavalable. It should be said that if they use drugs once, they will do it again. According to statistics, people could not to stop and apply with drugs for the rest of ther lives. 
For my opinion, illegal drugs-scandles should be solved by government and bounded any drugs in sports and competitions at all. Also it is not esential to discualificate athelets for the rest of teir lives, because they participates in competitions and do sports from the shildhood. Sport is the sense of their lives. 
In to conclude, there is only one view and it is important, that government should prevent sportsmen from drugs. Moreover, sports organisation should not abouned atheletes for whole life.
