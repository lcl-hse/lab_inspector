The illustrated bar chart depicts the quantity of people in the USA who use various kinds of social networks depanding on the age. 
The information is shown in percentage. Overall, we can see that Facebook exceeds all other popular websites. 
To start with, the graph reflects the downward trend of using Facebook and Instagram, which is connected with the age group. Old people do not tend to use these social networks, so we can see that the percentage of online adults is collapsing gradually. Another key thing to remember is that Linked Ln has another tendency, comparing with other two websites. The gab between teenegers and adults who use it does not widen at all. Moreover, we can notice that age group betwwen 30 and 64 is interested in Linked Ln most of all. 
To sum up, Facebook is depicted as the most wide-spread social network, but also as Instagram we can see the declining trend. The situation with Linked Ln differs from that and has some slight flactuations.
