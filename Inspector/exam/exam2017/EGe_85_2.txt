The great number of people enjoy watching different sports as on TV and on tribunes. Some people believe it is not worthy activity. From my point of view, it is rather useful hobby because of various reasons. In my essay I will discuss how it helps to develop relationships and improve a person's mood. 
Firstly, very often people watch matches with their friends and relatives or even if they watch them alone, they have somebody with whom he/she could discuss games. That is why they have more common topics, discussing matches they build emotional link. For example, my friends are great football fans and they root for the same team. So after every game they gather and discuss it very emotionally. 
Secondly, watching sports can improve your mood. When the team wins fans feel proud for it. Even if it fails, the game brings a lot of emotions and it can make person's life more interesting. Additionally, if a person does not root for any of teams, he/she can enjoy tight games. For example, my brother is a fan of one basketball team, he always waiting for its matches badly, he is extremely happy at that period. While and after watching he has a great range of emotions. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that of course every thing has both advantages and disavantages, but we should not forget that hobbies have a lot of social benefits, and observing of sports is not an exception. Sports can help people to make friends, to kill time, and experience a lot of emotions.
