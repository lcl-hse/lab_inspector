This chart illustrates information about development of the book market in USA, Germany, China and United Kingdom. The chart is based on number of printed books in 2014 and 2018 and eBooks in 2014 and 2018. 
Firsk of all, we can see a tendency of falling of printed book's market. This index in all countries is falling or stable, as in Germany. For example, USA demonstrates this more than other countries. In 2014 10,5 billion US dollars were payed for printed books. However, in 2018 this index is only 7,5 billions US dollars. In the same time, profit from selleng of eBooks increases 3 billion dollars. 
Nevertheless, many people continue to buy simple books. In German the situation is stable: 6 billion US dollars was payed in 2014 and it will be in 2018 too. Although eBook market gradually rose. 
Besides that, this chart can demonstrate the popularity of reading in this country. China has the biggest population in the world, as every person know, but Chinese book market is small: UK bookmarket less than it on 2 billion US dollars, although UK is smaller.
