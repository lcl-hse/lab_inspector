The presented diagrams show percentage of goods transported on the territory of Eastern Europe by rail and road in 2008. 
Different amounts of goods are transported by road and rail. As can be seen from the diagragms, metals contribute approximately one third of all transported by rail staff, and only one tenth part of all goods transported by road. In contrast, the percentage of delivered by rail goods is lower than by road and reaches only 11% comparing with 16%. Approximately the same part of manufacture goods is delivered by rail and road, however, food products' part in the whole delivery by rail is around 3 times lower and contributes 11%. Moreover, transported by road machinery is only 2% is contrast with 12% by rail and transited by road non-metallic minerals is 13% which is higher that the amount transported by rail. 
After all, it can be noticed that the ways of transportation of goods are different and depend on the form and quality of transited staff.
