The charts below represent data about the transportation of goods by rail and road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008. The first pie shows transportation by rail, and the second one by road. 
To start with, metals are the most transported good by rail, while by road the most transported are food products. It is obvious that transportation of manufactured goods is nearly the same by both of these means, 12% of machinery is transported by rail, and only 2% by road. The most striking fact is that less transported goods by rail are non-metallic minerals and machinery by road. What is more, it is seen, that the amount of transported chemicals are also close as manufactured goods. 
To sum up, I would like to say that the most transported good are manufactury (53%). The percentage of transported food products and metals a very close. Futhemore on the bottom of the chart are machinery goods and non-metallic minerals.
