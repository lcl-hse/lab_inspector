Nowadays small local businesses face one of the most important problems such as their replacement by big componies which are renowned for its name and brand. I strongly believe that there are more disadvantages rather than advantages. 
First of all, it is important to point out that big companies with multinational brands make their goods really expensive, the prices rocket but the quality stays at the same level while small componies are able to sell the things of good quality and the prices are not so high. This will help not wealthy people to have an opportunity to buy such things. 
Moreover, multinational componies are not eager to come up with new ideas. They have a famous brand and the customers who are eager to buy their goods while small local shops can give the buyers a lot of new and original goods and make up something new and extraordinary. There are a lot of similar things (clothes/shoes) in big famous shops which are worn by a lot of people everywhere. Sometimes people are embarassed when they meet people in the same clothes or trainers. 
However, there are some disadvantages. For example, shop assistents are really polite in multinational companies. They are always ready to hels clients, to offer tea or coffee, they can't be rude and agressive. There are underlaying causes why. The main cause is that such componies have name and they just can't afford to spoil all good comments of their customers. 
All in all, it is important to point out that although there are pros, cons outnumber them. Small local businesses have to be developed and the government should tackle this problem and to take measures like introducing more taxes for big companies or some restrictions for them.
