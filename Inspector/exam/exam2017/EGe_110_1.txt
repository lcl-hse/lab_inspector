The bar chart depicts the usage of various social networks by different age groups of adults in the USA in percentage. 
As it can be seen from the graph, Facebook is the most widely used social network among online adults of all ages, with the numbers varying from the highest of 87 percent of young adults and 56 percent of seniors using it. However, it is obvious that the network is mostly used by the younger generation. The same trend can be noticed with Instagram, which is most frequently used by the youngest age group. Instagram is most rarely used by the people of age, with only 6 percent of people over 65 years old having an Instagram account. 
LinkedIn, on the other hand, is most popular among people from 30 to 64 years old. The number of users of the youngest and the oldest age groups are equal - 22 percent. This can be explained by the different needs of each generation, with LinkedIn being more of a business social network, unlike Facebook or Instagram, which are used mostly for socializing and entertainment. 
Overall, it is obvious that the social networks one uses depend on one's age and needs corresponding to it.
