It is true that the number of health problems rise according to widely use modern technology. 
I believe that a lot of heart and brain health problem connected with widely use phones. We use it 24 hours a day 7 days a week. But it is not so good. Phones produced magnit waves, which influence on brain and heart. One of this problem is hard to concentrate and rapidly headache. It the most popular health problem in 21st century. We cannot live without phones and many people even don't know how it is dangerous. I'm agree that phones is an important part of our life but it will be better, if we try to decreas phone using. Children of 21st century start using tablets and phones already in 2-3 years old ages. It is awfull. Parents are not realized that in the future their children will have a lot of health problem. It will be better if modern egeniers and scihtiest solve the problem of magnt waves that we could use phones without damage.
