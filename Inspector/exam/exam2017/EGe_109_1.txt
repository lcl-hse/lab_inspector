The bar chart illustrates how US citizens of different age groups use various social networks. Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn are the major ones that are shown. 
Judging by the graph the Facebook is the most widely used by all of the people in the USA, just like the LinkedIn. Yet the amount of people of middle age (30-49 and 50-64) who use Facebook is twice bigger that the amount of ones who use LinkedIn - what is more, it seems to be the least popular among the youth. The vast majority of youngsters under thirty years use Facebook and Instagram, 87 and 53 percent respectively. While people that are older than sixty five almost don't use Instagram at all (6 percent). 
Overall, we can conclude that the social network Facebook that is made mostly for simple communication is widely used, at the same time such platforms for sharing pictures and working are not very favorable in the USA.
