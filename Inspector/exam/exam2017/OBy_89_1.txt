Musicians and film producers every year produce hundreds and hundreds music and films, new albums, more and more new original content. But some people do not want to spend their own money for things, that they can get free. They takes films from the internet, make copies and then give all that 'pirate materials' to another people. 
I think that we must buying original discs or original content in the internet. There are a lot of virtual stores like 'Steam', 'Origin', 'Playstation Store' that sold games, films, music to people, who want to support companies and their producers for their good job. 
But everybody know what rule, that says 'people who bownload files for free, instead of buying the original discs. Should be punished' - is only words on paper. Because there are a lot of people all around the world, that simple have no money to buying expensive content like a design program '3dMax'. If you want to buy it you must say 'Bye' near 130000 rubbles. Yes, you can find the students version of this program for 3 years, but if you are not a student and you are designer or you are another worker in this program - you have to choose, you must to choose - buy this program for a lot of money or download it from Net for free.
