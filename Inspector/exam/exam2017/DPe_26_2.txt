Nowadays, there are many sites in the Internet in which people can listen to music or watch films for free. However, it is suggested to be inequitable from people not to pay money for what they download from the Internet. Such people are supposed to be punished. I agree with this to some extent, but I think that it is more fair to punish those, who create pirate copies. 
On the one hand, people should not create illegal pirate copies and spread it through the Internet due to several reasons. To begin with, if people have free access to music or films, musicians and film producers do not get enough money for their work. In such case original discs remain unsold. Moreover, from point of law using illegal pirate copies is evaluated as theft. People who do not follow laws should be punished accordingly. If nobody is responsible for theft of music and films other people will not have incentives to buy the original discs and start to use pirate copies. 
On the other hand, copying and sharing music or films is not theft in its usual sense. It should not be equal to other thefts. Furthermore, it is necessary to punish not those, who download illegal copies, but those who create them. People who create illegal pirate copies are responsible for this and should be punished. Finally, ones who download illegal files may not completely understand what he or she does. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that it is necessary to punish people who create illegal pirate copies and not allow people to download such files.
