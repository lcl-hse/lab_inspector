The given pie-charts provide data on the transfering of goods in some countries of Eastern Europe by rail and by road in 2008. It is notably that trains largely transportated metals, while cars and trucks more dealed with food products. 
According to the charts, it is clear that heavy goods like metals, manufactured goods and machinery have been transportated by railway. On the contary, the roads were mostly used to move food and non-metallic minerals. However, the amount of manufactured goods and chemical products are nearly equal in terms of the way of transfering. 
It is remarkable, that the use of trains to transport machinery is quite ahead of the use of cars: in 2008 there has been 12% of transfered machinery by rail, while only 2% of it has been moved by road. 
In summary, the information presented in the charts shows that it is more convinient to transportate heavy subjects in huge amounts (such as metals) by trains, while every-day products (such as food) can be easily delivered by cars.
