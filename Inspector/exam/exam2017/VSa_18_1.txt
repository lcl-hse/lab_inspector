We are presented with two circle diagrams. The first diagrams shows the structure of the transportation of goods between countries in Eastern Europe by rail, and the second one shows the structure of the same subject for goods transported by road. For the rail-transported goods the main share consists of metals (35%) and manufactured goods (25%). Also there are three nearly equal shares of machinery (12%), chemicals (12%) and food products (11%). The last part is held with non-metallic minerals. For the road-transported goods there are two big parts, too. Food products (30%) and manufactured goods (28%) are about 60% together. Also there are huge amount of chemicals and non-metallic minerals (16 and 13%), and metals are only 11% and machinery is only about 2%. 
Summarising all of the above, we can see that metals and machinery are mostly transported by rail. Otherwise, food products and non-metallic minerals are transported by road more. In the end, chemicals has nearly the same share on the both diagrams, so it is transported by rail as often as by road.
