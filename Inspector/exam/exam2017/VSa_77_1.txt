The bar chart illustrates how the market of print books and eBooks is going to develop in the US, Germany, China and UK from 2014 to 2018. 
First of all, it is clear from the graph that American revenue was and might stay the highest one in both spheres in both periods. Second significant point is unpopularity of electronic books in China: the benefit from selling them will increase twice but, nevertheless, it is going to stay the lowest one with its figures 0,5 and 1 billion dollars in 2014 and 2018 respectively. Regarding other countries, Great Britain seems to be quite stable: the amounts do not fluctuate drastically, they are always about 2 billion. China and Germany are similar in their love to printed books comparing to their electronic alternatives: in Germany they provide six times more benefit than eBooks and approximately four times more in China. However, at the same time German figures are not that erratic and it is foreseen that they will stay the same. The United States demonstrate the great signs: from 5,5 bil. US dollars for eBooks (2014) to 10,5 for printed books (also 2014). the changes there are not so dramatic: prints are forecast to decline to 7,5 billion whereas eBooks are expected to increase the number of 8,5. 
Overall, electronic books might obtain the popularity in all the countries and this growth will the quickliest in America. The benefit from paper books is going to fall slightly but steadily, and the slowest one is going to be Germany.
