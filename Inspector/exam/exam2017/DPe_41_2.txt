Nowaduys, there are a lot of different illegal pirate copies in Internet. Some people believe that thiefes should be punished for illegal downloads and sharing music or films. This essay will discuss about actual problem in modern world and two different opinions about this cause. 
One point of view discuss about the private privelage and personal creution. For authors, whose plays are stolen, would be better to compensate this illegale process. Undoubteadly the government will spend a huge amount of money for that spends. But the justice for authors cost more. For instance, if someone steel a new album of favourite band it should be present as a purchase for authors. That would be great for both sides: band will be sure that if something goes wrong government will compensate some administration could catch thiefs and arrest them. 
On the other hand is law which will arrest all illegal downloads in particular coutry. For example, if government catch one thief and arrested him for two weeks, all another pirates will see the results of this illegal sharing. In that cuse many pirates could stop thiefing and start interesting what ever they want. Also, the administration could start banning all illegal sites. That would be much more useful in that situation. Thiefs couldn't share their files and band won't punish anyone. 
To sum up there are two different ways how to solve this probles. In my personal opinion government should ban illegal sources and do not punish pirates. If administration will controll mass media this actual problem could disappear.
