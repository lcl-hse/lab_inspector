There is no doubt, that nowdays there are plenty of British and American films in the cinemas. What is more, it becomes more and more possible to watch the original films in english with or without subtitles. 
In my opinion, the popularity of British and American films can be explained with economical factors. As the american and british economy are the first world economies through the last decades (or even a century), there was an opotunity to support financially local industries. Therefore, there are a lot of money spent on films and there are a lot of people, who work in the british and american film industries, which turns out to be an effective way to develop film making. 
From the other side, one of the reasons for that succes is that the british and american culture has a great influence all over the world. English is a widely spoken language, it is the international language. That is why it is much more possible to spare the english and american films, to translate them. As we all know, one of the most enjoyable way to learn language of some country is to participate in its culture, to watch films, to listen to music. 
That is why, in my opinion, if governments have as a goal the development of local film industries, they should spend more money on local films and look carefully that they are spent for the good reasons To conclude, I would say that we should inspire people in our country to create better films, we should show our interest in quality of the product.
