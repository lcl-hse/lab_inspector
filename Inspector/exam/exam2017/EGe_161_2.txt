Humans have been trying to learn more about the space for many years and by this moment a huge amount of work has been done. Besides, there are things that sould be solved as fast as it possible, but there is a question: what is more important to invest in? 
From my point of view, space exploration is one of the most significant parts of the country's position in the world. The more you are doing for this field, the more priviledges on the international scene you have. First of all, people tent to look in the future and they try to find a better place to live and raise children. For example, the number one issue in the space science: can we find a planet that has all the conditions human beings need? And scientists have been working on it for many years. What's more, today it is seems that the quantity of strenght and money a country spends on the space shows the real potential of this country. 
On the other hand, many people think that the social problems such as poverty or greenhouse effect, for instance, are much more important for the society. Firstly, the space exploration requires enormous amount of money which can be spent on lots of problems. Moreover, problems of space do not have average people's attention. They have other problems to deal with and do not see the advantages of being citizens of the great space country. 
However, I think that there are a plenty of ways to cope with this issue. If the government invest not so great sums of money in space, it will have more to give people to solve their problems. 
To sum up, I would like to emphasize that there is no right answer to this question: where we should spend money. Everyone has to deside for himself or herself. There are many anvantages and disadvantages from the both points of view.
