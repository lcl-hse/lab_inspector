It is not a surprise that nowadays the illegal copying and sharing music or filmes frowrishes and blooms. One category of society argues that such kind of pirates must be punished or even prisoned. Another group of people claimes that all individuals must get free access to all music clips, music compositions and films. 
Without doubts former position is good argumented one. People who download files with music and new film from internet without paying money, just do not respect individuals who created all this stuff. We all have person whos works we admire, can be producer or musician or actor. We all should understand that this person put his soul and heart into his creations. Moreover, the work of producer or musician is also a labour, a hard labour, and this hard labour must be paid. The wage of musician is the amount of money he got from selling his music. 
On the other hand many popstars as well as producers and musicians have a strong belief that people should have free access to they music and film. They told that if their music of films are really good people will buy disc with it. Indeed, this point of view seems to be widespread today. Many people pay for access to online cinema platforms or music online clouds like Itunes. As the advantage they get best conditions of watching films and sound characteristics. Futhemore, people prefer to go to the cinema to watch film if they know that film become the winner of the festival, it means that the firm is really worth and they want to spend they money on tickets or discs to watch it in perfect conditions in cinema. 
My point of view more closer to the second one, despite the arguments of the first group of people. I strongly believe that it is not relevant solution to give people free access to all pieces of music and films but the government don't have to punish people strictly for downloading files with music and films.
