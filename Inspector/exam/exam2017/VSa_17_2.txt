Nowadays there is popular opinion that the number of health problems is becoming bigger and bigger because of widespread use of modern technology. And here arises a question: is it really so? 
Unfortunately, today we can really witness that people suffer from different problems connected with heath. For example, a lot of people have bad eyesight due to using phones and watching TV very often. Another problem which is more dangerous and serious is that there is information overload in our modern world. Because of a lot of messages, phone calls and information people have stress and depression, which lead to nervous breaks. 
It goes without saying that some measures should be taken. From my point of view the only way to solve these problems is to reduce time which we spend using our telephones, computers and not waste time sitting near the television set. A wonderful solution is to have active way of life. For example, people need to go out and go for a walk more often, to do sports, fitness exercises. We should communicate with our friends and relatives in real life, and not by using social nets. Finally, another way to reduce time we waste on modern technology is to search information, write essays and study by going to the library but not searching the Internet. 
In conclusion I would like to emphasize that the widespread use of modern technology can lead to essential consequances connected with problems with our health like bad eyesight, nervous breaks. Special measures should be taken immediately and the only way to solve this problem is to reduce time which we spend using technology.
