The chart provides the information about the rate of unemployment in 5 world regions and worldwide in whole with the difference of one year - from 2014 to 2015. 
Generally speaking, we can say that there are no any dramatic increases or decreases in any of given regions, all changes in the chart are very gradual. The first thing that strikes the eye us the fact that areas with the highest and the lowest levels of unemployment didn't have any changes at all: N. Africa had 12,5 and S. Asia had 3,9 percent of unemployment both in 2014 and 2015. 
On the other hand, Middle East, which took the second place in the level of unemployment after Africa, had a small decrease from 11 percent in 2014 to 9,6 in 2015. The same can be said about Latin America, where the unemployment rate declined from 7,5 to 7,9 percent from 2014 to 2015. Otherwise, in EU the unemployment rate rised from 7,5 to 7,9 percent over the same period.
