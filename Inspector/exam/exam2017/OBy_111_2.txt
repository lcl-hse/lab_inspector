The problem of pirate copies is very acute nowadays. There are many people wo earn a livelihood by selling pirate copies and they still haven't been punished. But at the same time, there are many people of art industry who become victims of 'media' pirates. I will describe my opinion in the paragraphs below. 
First of all, I absolutely agree that it is sort of a crime to copy and share music or films or any kind of media on the internet without permission of the owner. There should be a special rule for that issue. To my mind, government should stricky prohibit internet thefts. 
Secondly, the reason why people downloade pirate copies is that generally usual internet users don't see any crime in it. So, government should pay a lot of attention to promote spreading of legal copies. We have seen some faint attemptions to promote legal copies via TV commercials but to me it is not enough. Usual internet users should not be punished for downloading pirate copies because sometimes it is the only way to get a very expensive and rare computer programs for free. However, conscientious, pirates should be punished because they do a serious act of crime. 
Speaking about worldwide experience, Hollywood movie makers have been working so hard to stop pirate copies. They put a lot of effort to prohibit illegal copying. They have a lot of rules that have been supported by the government. But sometimes rules don't work in the way they are supposed to. For example, recently there has been a pirate copy of new Sherlock Holmes series on the internet. Even director didn't know how that happened. It means that sometimes there should be drastic measures to avoid the spread of illegal copies. 
In conclusion, I think that it is fairly important to provide safe spread of movies or music and support legal copies. We have to fight with thefts and respect piece of art.
