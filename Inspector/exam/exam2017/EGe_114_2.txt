The amount of crimes increase every year. The most crimes are committed by young people. In this essay I am going to try to suggest some solutions which could help to prevent this problem. 
There are a lot of factors which involve on teenager's behaviour. But the most popular one is media. Teenagers spend most of their free time on the internet or wathing different TV programs. There are a lot of violence and crimes there which are shown like a real life and when young people watch this they try to immitate it. However, as for solution I can suggest that parents must control what their children watch and try to explain that this series or TV programs are just for entertainment and they should not copy behaviour from the antagonists of different TV series. Nevertheless, the good guys in the TV programs always win and fight with bad guys. 
Another factor which has got a huge affort are computer games. Scientits say that computer games have got a lot of advantages, but also disadvantages, for example agressive behaviour. Ten years ago happend one thing that a schoolboy spent many time playing GTA Vice City. It is the most violence videogame. Moreover, he stolen the car and than killed about 5 policemen. This occasion shows us how videogames affort on teenager's minds and parents should control their childer what their are doing. 
To sum up I would like to say that parents should control what their children do and teachers should provide deifferent lesson which help schoolboys or schoolgirls do not participate in different crime syndicates.
