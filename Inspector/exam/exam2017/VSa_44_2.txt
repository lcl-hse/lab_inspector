People argue: do modern technologies do harm to our health or not. 
In my oppinion modern technologies cause an increasing number of health problems. They are mostly connected with vision, our back and obesity. If we understand modern technologies as computers and smartphones then I think that they really do harm. Firstly, computers and work connected with seating cause less active lifestyle. It means that there are less callories spent and there is less blood cerculation. These are the causes of obesity. The other reason why smartphones and computers do harm to us is that they spoil our vision if we use them too much. 
On the other hand some people say that modern technologies are able to improve lifes of many people who were not able to deal with their deseases until modern technologies appeard. They suppose that modern technologies develop medicine and in such a way do good to us. 
I don't impose my oppinion but still I think that they cause health proplems. But those problems can be reduced by proper usage of gadgets. We should be more active during our work on computers, we should seat properly on the desks. 
To sum it up, I think that modern technologies made number of heath problems more, but these problems more, but these problems became less dangerous due to them.
