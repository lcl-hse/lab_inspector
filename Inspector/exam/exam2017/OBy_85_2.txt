Illegal pirate copies is biggest problem for musicians and film products nowadays. And some of them think, that people, who copying, sharing or downloading films or music from internet, should be punished. I would argue that there is two sides of this problem. 
On the one hand, the pirate copies doesn't let musicians and produsers earning more money, they could lose million of dollars because of pirate copies. Also, because of this reasone they could lose motivation to create anything else. Do you remember what Beoynce said once? 'If you are adore what I do, if you respect me as a person, if you are my truly fan, you will buy only official products by me'. 
On the other hand, let's look on people who, for example can't efford a ticket to the cinema? Or they just can't buy an official Beoynce album in Itunes. So what do they have to do? Are anyone able to make them to stop loving Martin Scorsese movies or Beoynce songs? No. These poor people go to the pirates sites because of love to their favorites actors/singers. Not because of bad minds or something like that. 
In conclusion I want to say, that downloading a pirate copies from internet isn't a crime, it makes singers/actors more famous anyway. And maybe, if the pirate copies problem will be solved one day, all this famous people could lose a lot of their truly fans.
