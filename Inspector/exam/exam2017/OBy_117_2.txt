The illegal piracy copyright policies have been always crucial issues in XX and XXI centuries. I totally agree that musicians and producers have been getting a huge amount of lots of money while there piracy flourishing. From my own perspective, I consider that the overwhelming and tremendous job of creators should be respected and copyright policy strictly complied. We should understand that musicians and movie producers have spent a tremendous time and budget in order to bring this masterpiece into real life. 
Nothing can be free! If you considered others produce for free than you have to do the same thing work free? However, human's self-egoism wants only him being paid and others labor for free. Therefore, relasing piracy copies and downloading creators works for free form left online pages brings a great harm and even may prevent a future best products from occurring since creators are lost in the previous one and have no intentions to generate another one. 
Unfortunately, in our country the fight against piracy is not well established or well developed in the comparison with west countries such as EU or North America, In our dauly life we can be witness of many our friend who are occuped with piracy downloading of movies or music. From my perspective, we have to use soft power point of punishment and get people fined police for that actions that can be beneficial for both for the government and the producers of thus masterpieces.
