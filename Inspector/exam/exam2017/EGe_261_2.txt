Crimes have always been serious social issue. It is even more relevant nowadays, when the amount of crimes rises every year in our country. There are many arguements about ways of lowering the level of crimes in the society, so let's look at both opinions. 
Some people think, that the most effective way of dealing with criminal problem is giving longer prison sentences. They say that it makes people more afraid of the punishment for the crimes they could commit, so in this case fear can prevent crimes. 
They also state that isolating all the criminals from the society for a long period of time is much more effective, because If all the criminals cannot commit crimes, the problem is solved, so prison is a perfect measure of social safety. Finally they say that prison can teach people how to become healthy part of the society, so schools and education in prisons can help people to socialise after leaving the prison. 
But there is another opinion. There are people who think that prolonging prison sentences can just make the whole situation worse. Firstly, the prison cannot make people better. There are no proper system of prison education in our country, so people in prisons just do not get opportunity to take any kind of courses. Secondly, the chance of becoming part of the criminal world is much higher in prison, especially for young people, Thirdly, just isolating criminals from the society does not stop other people from commiting new crimes. 
As for me, I strongly believe that prison can niether stop people from commiting crimes, nor make people better citizens. Prison just ruines people's lives. It is well shown in Shalamov's stories or the tale of Showshenk by Steven King. People in prison can just commit new crimes, because there is no other way for them to live. To conclude, Though there is an opinion that main measure of dealing with crime issue are prisons, I so not agree. I sill believe that there are many other social ways to deal with this problem
