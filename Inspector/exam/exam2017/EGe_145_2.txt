The situation with crime in recent years has changed so that most of the illegal actions are being commited by the youth. There are several major reasons that cause such tendency. This essay is aimed to reveal causes and give some solutions to overcome the problem. 
First of all, many researches proved that there are high rates of crime nowadays due to the fact that younger people commit crimes. It is told that many of them were born and live in the areas where a burglary or even a murdery are everyday things. These teenagers originate from families where there are only one parent or parents work hard to bring up children so breadgivers do not have that much time to spend with their own children. It could be suggested to parents to try and find some time to talk more to their children, educate them, discribe them what is allowed to do in the society. Children should be given more attention from parents. For example, supportive talks with children, asking about their lifes, everyday dinner together can help to change the situation for the better. 
Secondly, the moral values of modern society have changed. It became a commom thing among teenagers to do something illegal. One thing that can be done to solve the problem is to pay more attention to this problem at school. For instance, teachers can give lectures about the drawbacks and outcomes of commiting a crime where they will explain to the youth everything. Moreover, more literature with positive and apprecheated life examples can be read during the lessons. 
To conclude, it can be said that regardless of differnt reasons of crimes we should start doing something to prevent new crimes. Personally I suppose that combining both of these methods will give the best result and have a real influence on what the younger generation considers to be right.
