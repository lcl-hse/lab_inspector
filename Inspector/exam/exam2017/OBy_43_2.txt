I don't know what is 'wide spread' but I know that technology and modern manufacturing is cause of a lot of health problems. 
It is actually in cities, because city is uncial place for living, it is antonym for 'wild routine'. Cities has their own weather and climat, it is first cause of problems, like cold feats, but it is not general. There is more massive problems, like transport or factories. 
Firstly, I talk about transport. It call 2 types of problems: contemporary problems with health from transport is, for example, if you are hit by car and now your arm is broken. Long-lasting problem from transport is gases in air, gases from engines, can't name a problem but I know then breathing by period wastes is not so helpful for your body. We can solve that problems, if we use electro-engines or something like that. Secondly, big problem is factories, of course. One factory can do a lot of things, legal or nor, that causes problems with our health. For example, factory put wastes to nearly lake, fish in lake eat wastes and became not so good for eating, but we don't know it, and that fish was killed and served to our kitchen table, and after that we had stomach problems. 
Well, modern technology society causes a lot of troubles to routine, and sometimes we forget that we are nature, and we make problems for ourselves. Mankind makes troubles to mankind, and we must control this situation.
