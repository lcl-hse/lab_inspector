The use of dopping in professional sport is staying on of the vital problems nowadys. This issue is strongly a debats in society. One part of society suppose that sportsmen, who used illegal grugs, must be banned from competitions only for a limited period, while the another part of society think that professional sportmen be banned for the end of their lives. 
People, who has first opinion, think that all people can have a mistakes, and the society shall give professional athletes chance to improve situation. Moreover, in some of situation surounding people are blamed in using drugs by sportsmen because they wait results and it is stress for sportsmen. 
Another part of society suppouse that using of illegal drugs in serious and unexused mistake for professional sportsmen. 
Such behavior of athletes is bad exemple for others, espessially for a children, who like see sport programm on TV and do professional sport. Also, they that competition must be honest and all sportsmen should know rules and achieve their results and aim in honest competion, so using illegal drugs, in opinion of that people, is very serious mistake and it is essential for society to bann such athletes for the rest of their lives. 
Taking different mentioned above into consideration, I strongly believe, that all people have a right to mistake and professional discvalification for athletes should be limited.
