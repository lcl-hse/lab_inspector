Modern technology have have became an a important part of our lifes. Now we use our laptops and mobile phones everyday. Maybe even every hour. It's good or not? Modern technologies are a big step to out light and simply future or a reason of problems connected with human health? 
Compares to nowadays, the previous century, time without Internet Connection and mobile technologies is the happier time. Firstly, people read a lot. Nowadays we can't read a lot not only because we have more interesting deals in Internet or we are mobile addicted. No, we simply do not have time. Some people read books in their mobile phones but there's appear a problem with eyes a health. More and more people are wearing a medical glasses nowadays, because can't see well. 
Also some problems are based on technologies connected with big manufactures. As a conclusion of this manufactures work can be air and water pollution. 
In my opinion, technologies is the best way to take new knowledges and educate people more quickly, but they can make determination affect for a human health.
