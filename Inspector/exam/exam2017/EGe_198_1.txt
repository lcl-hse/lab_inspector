There is an information about the average time which English people spent doing sport exercises in 2012. As one can notice given bar chart describes the difference by age and gender what allows us to compare both men's and women's involvment in active way of living and youth and older participation in a sport life. It is quite obvious that younger people in England do more activities than elder people what is shown by the fall towards the age of 75. This pattern may be noticed both for English men and women. However, the crucial defference between sport life of both genders is that men do less exersises that women at all what can be suppotret by the figures given in this bar chart. For example, taking into consideration the age between 16 and 24 the amount of time spent by women is twisely more than spent by men (282.1 minutes against 114.1 minutes). Moreover this tendency follows all ages excluding the age of 55-64 where men do more exersises that women. The average time spent on sport falls when people become older what tells us that youth are more interested in keeping sport life style in comparison to older people who tend to sedentary life style. In conclusion it is worthy to notice that in average men in England spend less time than women doing sport exersises.
