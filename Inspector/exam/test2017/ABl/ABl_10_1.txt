This chart shows us the data about the unemployment in a few world areas. The data is divided into the information about 2014 and 2015 unemployment levels. 
It is clearly seen that there are two main trends. Firstly, the level of unemployment did not change at some areas such as N. Africa and S. Asia where that level remained stable. Secondly, it is shown that that level decreased at some regions. 
Talking about details, we can see that the level of unemployment decreased rapidly in the two regions. It went from 11 to 9,6 points in the Middle East, and it also went down from 6,8 to 5,8 points in the Latin America. However, there is an unusual trend. In contrast to the previous examples, the EU's level of unemployment rose by the 2015 from 7,5 to 7,9 points. 
In general, it is shown that there were different trends at the different areas. However, the worldwide indicator did not change at all.
