Nowadays young generation spend too much time sitting at home and they have less interaction with real world. Teenagers do not take part in nature's improvement. It is significant problem that children do not appreciate nature and do not want to communicate with and there are some reasons about this sensitive issue. 
The first reason is fashion, of course. It deals a great influence to children and society, too. Young generation prefer to sit at home, chatting with their friends or playing computers games than go outside and play football or do some sport activities it is a kind of trend that young generation communicate with nature less than in the past. For instance, my little sister do not want to go anywhere after school and when I ask her why she did not go for a walk she answered me as "I have enough friends in social sites to speak with, so I do not want to walk". 
The second reason is the laziness of young generation. They would like to sit on their armchair, eating chips and drinking Cola while chatting with friends or playing their x-box than go outside, feel fresh air, go running or just sit under the tree. Children prefer doing less hard activities and spending their time with calm. This situation concerns myself, too. When my father bought me a PC, I also started to spend more time indoors so I became lazier. 
To conclude, there are different aspect why children contact less with natural world than in the past, but this problem should be solved somehow. If it do not, future generation will have a great problem with their health.
