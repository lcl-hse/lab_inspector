The graph illustrates the proportion of urban and rural population that used the Internet between 1999 and 2004. 
Overall, there is an upward trend in the percentage of people who used the Internet both in big cities and countryside. On the whole, urbanized population used twice as much Internet facilities as suburban households. In 2000 the proportion of Internet access of urban citizens was approximately a third in contrast with rural population which used only about 5%. The situation changed a bit in 2003, when people from suburbs had about a half of Internet access of the people in large cities. The highest proportion of Internet Access, reached by urban people was approximately 60%, whereas the major norny of the rural population was about 35%. My contrast, the starting point of Internet Access of rural households was only about 1%, while the initial percentage of Internet usage of urban population was approximately 15%.
