The chart provides the information about how many people living in cities and in the countyside of Europe were equipped with Internet from 1999 to 2004. 
Generally speaking, the largest proportion of Internet users was among urban and suburban households. The number of the group reached a peak of nearly 55% in 2004. At the same time the percentage of rural households was soaring from 2% in 1999 to just 35% in selected 2004. 
If we compare both groups, it can be seen that during the period the proportion of country-side users of Internet grew dramatically, while urban and suburban users seemed to stop a rapid growth in 2002. Moreover, rural households increased the total percentage from 2% to 35%, while urban users soar the number by almost 40%. 
It is evident that access of Internet in selected period rocketed more rapidly in rural areas, but the overall proportion was the highest among city and town citizens.
