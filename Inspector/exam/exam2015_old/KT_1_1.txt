The graph illustrates the percentage difference of access to the Internet of urban/suburban and rural households in European country between 1999 and 2004. 
As we can see from the graph, more urban households had Internet access, than rural households, because in the country people have no time for it. In the begining of 20th century there was a huge development of computer technology, that's why the percentage of urban households that had Internet and computers began to rise up. This development had a small influence on a country, as we can see from the graph. 
In 1999 only 2 percents of rural houses and 15 percents of urban houses has access to the Internet, but in 2004 55 percents of urban houses and 35 percents of rural houses. 
Overall, after the appearance, the Internet became more popular every year not only in big cities, but also in a country. It is explained by the huge development of computers technologies, that more appearance in towns and less in the country.
