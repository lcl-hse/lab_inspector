The graph illustrates us the percentage of urban and rural households in a European country, which use Internet access for six-year-period (between 1999 and 2004)
As we can see, the number of people who have Internet in their homes increased every year both in urban and rural areas. Of course, the percentage of people who have Internet in urban areas is highter. It's biggest growth was between 1999 and 2000, when it increased from 15% to 30%. 
Stealing about rural areas, we can see, that however number of people, who use Internet access in their places, less than in urban areas, it still increases. And the differences between urban and rural areas cut down every year. 
To sum up, the percentage of urban/suburban household Internet accesses increased almost by 4 times and the percentage of rural household Internet accesses increased almost 8 times, that in general speaks about the development of the Internet in the country.
