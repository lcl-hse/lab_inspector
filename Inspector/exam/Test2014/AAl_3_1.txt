The graph presents the data about the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in the different countries. 
According to the graph, X axis indicates the number of per cents and Y axis indicates years. Here are presented 3 lines (each line indicates each country) - Japan, Sweden and USA. The lowest level of population's proportion belongs to Japan. It reaches a low from 1960 to 1960 (3%) a after the start to increase rapidly - up to 27% in 2040, there Japan reaches it's peak. Sweden a USA have approximatly the same level of proportion: Both countrier fluctuate since 1940 from 7% a 9%, after this to 12% a 15% in 1980. But from 1995 Swedish line increases sharply to 20% in 2015, unlike US's line, which starts to decrease slowly from 15% to 13% (1980-2020). And, at last, both counties start in increase it's levl of population proportion a in 2040 reach it's maimum - Sweden - 25% a US - 23%. 
To sum up, the statystics indicates, that Japanese population's proportion is changing slowly, instead of Swedish a American rates, which are fluctuated. But, the highest level of proportion is reached by Japan, in contrast with Sweden a US, which have lower maximum rate.
