The presented barchart compares numbers of urban/suburban and rural households that had a connection to the Internet in a period from 1999 to 2004 in Europe. 
It is clearly seen, that both of three subjects had a noticeable grow during six years. Urban and Suburban ones kept leadership, that was obvious in 1999, until the end of 2004, while their oponents started with a tiny percentage and then increased greatly, reaching more than 35% of internet connected.

Even when the percentage of the first type went up to 5%, the second sector doubled to the end of the 2000 and saved tendency to grow slightly for all remaining period. Talking about Internet conected rural households, it must be admitted, that its part in the graph had a strong increase with a 10% gain per year.
