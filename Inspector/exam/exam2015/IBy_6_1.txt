The table which is given at the task describes underground railway characteristics in six different cities. As shown on the table the first underground was built in 1863 in London, so it is the oldest one at the table and the latest open date has underground from Los Angeles, it is only 14 years old compare to 152 years of London's underground. Also, it is worth mention that almost all undergrounds were built in 20th century. London's underground is the longest one, it has 394 kilometers of route. and the shortest one is in Kyoto, perhaps because Kyoto is smaller than London. It is interesting to see that dispite of the London's underground is the biggest one, Tokyo underground has more passengers per year about 1927 millions, but London has about 775 millions. What is more, the shortest underground has the smallest number of passengers per year only about 45 millions. To sum it up, all undergrounds has specific characteristics, some of them are long old instead of others which are young and only going to become large undergrounds.
