Nowadays children are influenced by the fast rhythm of life and as a result the usually spend their leisure time at home in front of TV or in shopping centres. So they do not spend much time outdoors at the open air close to nature. As for me, it is significant for children to explore nature and treat it with care. 
First of all, it is crucial for young people to keep in touch with nature because, for instance, if a child gets lost in the forest, he or she will not be able to recognize right location without some basic knowledge of nature. Secondly, every person should understand that nature is our home and we should take care of it. So children should be taught this approach from the early age. Moreover it is essential to explore nature for young people because, though nature is our home, it is also full of mistery and danger and being aware of some natural tricks is expecially important even for a child's well-being. In addiction, these things will work only if a child is close to nature. 
On the other hand there is an opinion that studying nature is of no importance and children can juat read some facts about nature in books or watch some discovery channels. Besides, children are able to hurt themselves while exploring the nature or playing outdoors close to it, so parents just set their children in 'cages' of shopping mals and cinemas. 
In conclusion, I strongly believe that children should spend most of their free time outdoors, exploring nature so as to understand it and try to take care of it in the future.
