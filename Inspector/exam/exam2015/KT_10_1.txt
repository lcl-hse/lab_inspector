The table below illustrates the percentage of houses in the towns and in the countryside of a European country which had an Internet access from 1999 to 2004. 
Generaly speaking, it is seen that both compared groups had a huge increase at this period of time. The quantity of urban and suburban households having an access to the Internet was ten times bigger than an amount of rural houses (15% and 15% respectively). By the end of this period the percentage of countryside houses connected to the Internet was about 35% what was more than a half of an amount of urban houses (55%). It is stated that during the period of time the number of households using Internet in cities has rocketed up to 50% (between 1999 and 2002) and then grew slightely.
