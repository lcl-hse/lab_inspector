It is time that air travel is one of the reason why air pollution and global warming are increasing nowadays. Some people, and I am among them, believe that special laws should be introduced in orders to reduce the number of business and leisure flights. Firstly, there are other ways of moving around that could substitute air travel even when speed is the key factor. For example, modern trains, such as "Supsan", are both convenient and really fats, so it would be reasonable to use them ore often of they contribute less to air pollution and global warming. Secondly, a lot of flights are inefficient, because celebrites or governmental people use large personal planes which could potentially carry more passengers. As many of these flights are for leisure, governments should control their frequency when it is possible. However, some people argue that there are areas where moving by plane or helicopter is much easier than by train or by car. They also say that when the distance is long the speed difference between aircrafts and vehicles becomes more significant. I agree with them to some extent. However, these arguments only mean that the laws reducing air travel should consider all the peculiarities of the region, travel distance and whether or not it is an important trip. All in all, I believe that governments should control the amount of air travel for leisure and business, reducing the numbers of flights when it is possible orders to reduce air pollution and global warming.
