Nowadays thanks to globalization there is steadily increase of using of air transport, which has been proven to countribute signiticantly to air pollution and global warming. Some people decree that governments should reduce the amount of air travel by introducing some specific laws. In my opinion, air travel greatly involves on globalization and there are so many other more damaging processes with problems that really should be solved. 
With a rise of machinery throught globalization, there is a rise of some types of transport which can help to connect many countries for some government and business needs. Also, such transports like air transport male people closer and the distance shorter. 
Consequantly, trips are easier now, it let us to go wherenever we want and desire. 
Where are a lot of another problems that take more damage that air travel. Firstly, factories produce a lot of gases polluting the environment. Ot course, government already takes taxes from such companies, but from my point of view, it is not enough. Secondly, other vehicles like cars, buses really pollute air. Althought, there are a lot other doing like deforestation. So, the government should pay attention on this sides, because without air transportation it is complicated to connect between develop and developing countries. 
Probably, I think that government should not reduce the amount of air travel for business, because they gain much money from that by selling and buying sometimes air transport can fly almost empty, without passaegers. It can be because of unsuitable weather for travel. Many tourists prefer just summer to go abroad. 
To sum up, I would like to say that air transport has much power to connect countries and it is self-crident tuar positive sides of this process is more important than drawbacks, because these negative sides have more important reasons to became.
