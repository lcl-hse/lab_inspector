The charts give information about how the use of Facebook changed from March 2012 to March 2013 and also provide data about both males' and females' reasons for using Facebook. The first bar chart gives information about the number of people using Facebook at their desktops and mobiles both in 2012 and 2013. We can see that the usage of Facebook at desktops proved to be higher than that at mobiles during 2012 and 2013 with numbers 150 and 138 million (approximately) compared to approximately 58 and 98 million respectively. In 2013 the number of people using Facebook at desktops proved to be a little bit smaller than in 2013 with rates 150 and 138 millions (approximately). However the number of users of Facebook at mobile increased notably in 2013 (approximately 98 million) in comparison with the rate of approximately 58 million for 2012. The second chart provides data about the main reasons for using Facebook among both males and females. One of the main reasons of using Facebook is recieving updates and the equal percantage of men and women shared it (39%). Women were more likely to use Facebook than men in order to share photos or videos (with numbers 54% versus 39 % respectively) and to see funny posts, for which the numbers are 43% for females and 35% for males. Also women tended to use Facebook for learning about possible ways to help others more often than men with 35% compared to 25% respectively.
