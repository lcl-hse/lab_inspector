The topic show us a two opinion about the complicated problem and I partly agree with given ways to solve this issue. on the one hand, people think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. It is an interesting solution and I think it can work because any prison sentences has a positive impact on prisoners. If prisoners will be situated in special places longer, they can change their mind and learn some profession, which helps our society. But longer sentences with such programs, so expensive governments and it can will be a problem for states economy. That's why, this solution can use only a poverty countries. On the other hand, others believe that we should image a alternative ways of reducing crime. In my opinion, government need divide a prisones depends on their case and we most dangerous prisoners must be killed. According to statistics, the contries, where death penalty is allowing has a less crime percentage rather states, which do not use it but, death penalty is non-ethical and many countries and people will never use this solve. It mean that problem is staying an solving. From my point of view, hard rules also can increase a crime percent ages. For example, huge taxes on priosner's family will have a waste impact on people. To sum up, I would say that a longer prison sentences is not a single solution. Fro crime problem with developing of our society people will find a way to make a crime, but also I believe that another persons will always search an alternative ways of reducing crime.
