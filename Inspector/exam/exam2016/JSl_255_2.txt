There is a widespread opinion that Facebook and Vkontakte were created for sharing information and knowledge. However, some people think that these internet sites need for entertaining. So, who is right? My essay will look both at two these points of view. Firstly, it is believed that we should use Facebook and Vkontakte for sharing information. It is very convenient for many reasons. Students can share their thoughts about lectures, ask for home tasks, discuss their subjects, universities and so on. Moreover, people who do not see each other for a long time can tell each other about their location. The most interesting periods of their lives and discuss their future meeting. Besides, Facebook and Vkontakte are good for business people because they can discuss some serious questions which can be solved by the internet. So they do not have to spent their time on meeting. A lot of universities have their own official pages on Facebook, so students from different countries can find the information. They need about entering this university. There is another point of view that the main reason why we use Facebook and Vkontakte is our desire to entertain. With the help of these two sites we can learn a lot about new films, we can watch them, listen on-line books and so on. People find their favourite songs in Vkontakte, watch clips and comment them. Also there are a lot of funny games: from how to dress the princess to games with cars. Facebook and Vkontakte are full of social tasks which you can write when you are bored. In the conclusion, it must be said that people use Facebook and Vkontakte for different purposes. Some prefer find and read articles about science, environment, social problems, but others use them just for watching films, video and listening music. In my opinion, the main purpose of Facebook and Vkontakte is haring information and knowledge. These sites are full of interesting facts and articles from, which you can learn a lot.
