Being a businessman is now one of the most prestigious kind of job. As a result there are many different companies nowadays and some of them finally go to the international level. So they struck with a problem of the lack of working people. Where do they need to take them and where they should keep their business is one of the most daily issue in business. One possible solution is to move the business from the rich developed country to one poorer developing country. First of all, this solution is so popular because of the number of local workers in theese countries who cannot get work at home and who are ready to be employed even for a small fee. This reason is the main in Russia where there are thousands foreign workers from poor countries to the south of Russia. One of the other possible benefits from moving the business is a cheap space. Using the placements in poor countries businessmen mustn't pay a high rent price. Unfortunately, it can be easily proved by russian example. Russian businessmen remove cellars and the workers are forced to work in strong conditions. Even though there are many advantages for companies, there is one obvious disatvantage - poor countries are not the best place for doing business, because people living there have not enough money.
