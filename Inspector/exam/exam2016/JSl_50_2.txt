As we can see, modern world is full of different companies and the contest of rising concurse tension some of companies deside to move their production lines to some poor countries. But does this decision really useful? Some of advantages of such kind of decisions seems really attractive. For example, such measures will bring some economical profits for the company, such as low cost of labor force, low tax rate and planty of people who are willing to work for any sum of money. Moreover, the "host country" benefits too. The government collect more taxes. People have waraing places. Almost, one of the advantages of such decision is including of country in modern global economicy, giving impulce to the globalisation. On the other hand the "mother country" of such company have less in taxes. Moreover, it almost last a huge amount of working places elevating the problem of unemployment. Modern socials are struggeling with the problems and replacing of industy just makes the thing worse. And, finally, country still have some problems in addition to benefits, for example the low rate of human rights and low level of life. And still, this country becomes dependent on foreign capital, wich can become an obstacle for development of local industry. As we can see disadvantages outweight the advantages, and it becomes obvious in the contect of soviety benefits. Modern countries try to return industry from the outside because they lost a lot of profit. And I am totally agree with such position, as I think that the country can't be convically strong without industry. In conclusion I would like to add, that, of course, companies gain a lot from moving their business to same not-so-rich countries, but their own society have just tosses.
