In contrast, mobile phone has become much more popular among Facebook users with the performance of about 95 million of users in 2013, which is circa 40 million more than in 2012. Nevertheless, the indices of mobile Facebook remaned significantly lower than those of desktop Facebook, reaching a peak at about 95 and 150 million of users, respectively. As it can be seen from the second graph, the majority of women, namely 54 %, consider that sharing photos or videos is the main purpose to use Faceboof while men vote equally for sharing files and receiving updates. The less important reason among both men and women seems to be learning about the ways to help others, moreover, this reason has the same percentage of voters among women as seeing funny posts.
