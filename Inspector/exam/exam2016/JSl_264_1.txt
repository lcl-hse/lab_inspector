The bar chart gives the overview of the time spent on doing leisure and sports in 2012 in England. It is clear that the number of minutes spent on sports by men is a lot higher then the same of women. Doing sports takes twice more time by men then by women by ages 16-24. However, when the residents get older the time spent on sports decreases get the trend still exists. This trend only breaks once of the ages 55-64 where the number of minutes spent by women is slightly higher than by men. Another break of trend is that the time spent on sports by women of ages 25-34 and 25-44 remained unchainged and made the number of 92,8 minutes. To summarize this low chart gives us the understanding that men spend more time on doing sports and exercises than women do, however, while getting older this time significantly decreases.
