On our world we have one big problem. It's a problem of ecology. And one of the most important question in this area is a question of global warming. Big part of this problem is a demand of air travel. In one moment we have a thousands of planes who didn't our life and air more clear. On the one hand, it's a real problem for humanity and governments can be right in this question. We can choise other type of transport when it's a possible. Humanity can invent new types of travel. For example, director of first big company of electric cars introduce new type of fast transport - magnetic tube. And every year we get new good concepts. Maybe we can deny from planes sometimes? On the other hand we can't deny from planes now. Because today it's a faster way for travelling. In business every hour is important. Time is money. And our life is too short. We can't lose many time in way. At the end I want to say again that government is right on this situation and it's a really good that they thinking about ecology and future of our planet. We must love our planet and we mustn't destroy it. Our children will grow up here. I think we live in era when we began care about whole situation! Let's think about next generation!
