The current time many businessmans tend to use developing countries as a demetory where they are able to find plave for their factories and cheap working power. There own-debates about this development it has more advantages or not? Taking a look at this poor countries of the beging we can say " Yes of course". Because, first of all, these international companies give working places for people who have not a diploma of degree, have not experience (young generation) or money. For example, we know that China has a lot of citizens but other they are not able to find a job and in this case such companies help them to servive. Secondly, their buildings often stay in a same distance from towns and cities, so they have to create new roads and facilities. It is undoubtedly, one of the main prons of their business. Nevertheless, it has its own disadvantages. Initially, such kind of companies never care about the nature when surrunds their factories. Workers pollute rivers, cut forests and change the ecosystem of the area where their building located. What is more, the quality of goods. My brother month ago bought a telephone by Apple because it was cheap. But after one short "flight" yesterday it crashed. And my brother not the one victim of such bad-quality good. Taking everything into consideration, I can say that the advantages overweigh all minuses of this development. Because in spite of everything these businessman bring more good things, such as employment, roads and other facilities which in their turn will able to lead to a better life.
