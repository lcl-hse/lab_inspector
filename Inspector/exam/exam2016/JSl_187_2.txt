There is tendency to believe that if we makes prison sentences longer, than the crime level will be goes down. However, someone suppose that it is not the only and best way of decrease of one. In fact, such statement may be well founded, because more strict laws motivate bandits to change their opinion about possible consequence. In fact, it is extremely challenging to understand their behavior and predict wheather this way changes their mind. It can be noticed that longer prison sentences may be an effective way to reduce crime, if it is not the only accepted measure. In my view such campaigns should include complex activities such as more qualify prison security in order to avoid running from prison. Moreover, it tends to believe that people working in the government or businessmen who have a huge influence alwase have a way to avoid a prison, if they broke a law. In this way, fighting with corruption if one of most vital measures, which will probably causes the reduction of crime. Overall, suppose it is excellent way not to come up with way to decrease the crime level, but to research the current situation in the world to find countries with the lowest crime level and understand the main reasons and aspects of that successful situation. As a result, government of other countries will gain an experience. To conclude, reduction of crime level is extremely important, but still challenging problem. Unfortunately, in my opinion, there is no universal algorithm, how to reduce it, and such problem will not be solved only by increasing prison sentences. The measures must be complex and should be inextrible linked to different areas of our social life.
