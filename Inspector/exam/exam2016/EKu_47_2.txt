It is not an easy question to discuss whether different international companies should help any developing countries by moving their businesses. In my opinion, this policy has more advantages that disadvantages. In my essay, I will try to prove my suggestion. First of all, for people living in any developed country there are more opportunities to be hired, to find the job. That is why sometimes a significant number of companies should wait until an employee wants to join the group. However, by moving the businesses to poorer countries, these international companies will be able to hire workers sooner because these people need any work. Moreover, these companies can also paid them a little less thus increasing the profit. On the other hand, thanks to this policy, managers will have an opportunity to find unique workers who may be do not have any diploma of higher education; however, they can be creative and have some essential for the companies skills. For example, the person from the any developing countries of Africa can create the jewerly collection inspired the culture of his own country. And then these products may be sold in America. Moreover, if we want to save our word and live in peaceful place, we should help poorer countries to survive. By moving their business, international companies can save people from the hunger, give them a chance to live happily. To sum up, there is a considerable number of advantages for international companies to move their businesses to poorer countries. In this case, they will be able to give people work, to launch new products, sometimes to reduce costs and increase benefits, and what is important to help different people live in a happy word.
