In last decades air travel has developed significantly: new planes were designed, some of them are more ecologically- friendly than thei previous ones, many new air companies were established. At the same time the number of flights have soared and led to air pollution and global warming, nonetheless, it can be argued that governments should regulate the amount of air travel. On the one hand, people who require to introduce laws to limit air travel are right too. Firstly, it is a well-known fact that planes indeed produce much pollution and cause global warming. There are many interesting and disappointing researches on this theme. Secondly, there are really a lot of air trips which are not necessary for people but people allow themselves it because of law prices in flights. Such prices increase the amount of flights and, unfortunately, the quantity of air crashes are rising too. On the contrary, afordable air travel results in many benefits. For example, despite the rising number of air crashes it remains the safest transport. Also people save much time travelling by planes. In addition, air travel supports business very much and it leads to the GDP growth of countries, and it can help people to integrate and to invent new planes which would be faster and use less petrol, for instance. To conclude, air travel had provided people with many benefits and the entire world should cooperate to develop if in order to get more advantages from it.
