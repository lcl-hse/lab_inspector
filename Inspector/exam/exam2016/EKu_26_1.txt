There are two graphs representing different information. The first graph shows number of users that use Facebook from different platforms (desktop and mobile) in 2012 and 2013. The second graph represents men and women's opinions about "main reasons" for using Facebook (percentage data). Both the first graph and the second one show comparative information. According to the first graph, use of desktop version of Facebook slightly decreased from March 2012 to March 2013 in approximately 20 millions of users. However, desktop version was still more popular than mobile version in March 2013 (and in March 2012 too): there was about 130 millions and 97 millions of people correspondingly. The most interesting observation is that number of mobile version users changed dramatically: from up to 60 million in 2012 to up to 100 million in 2013. As for reasons for using Facebook, there was one which showed no gender differences: receiving updates is equally important for men and women. For some reason women value all other reasons more than men: 54% of women and 39% of men think that sharing photos or videos is one of the main reasons to use Facebook, 43% and 35% for seeing funny posts, 35% and 25% for learning about ways to help others (correspindingly).
