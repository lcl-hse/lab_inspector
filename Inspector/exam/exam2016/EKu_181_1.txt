The diagram illustrates the changes in the investment of renewable energy over an eight year period. It is a combination of a line graph, which demonstrates worlwide spendings, and a bar chart, which stands for developed and developing countries. In 2006 the worldwide investment accounted for 100 billion dollars, then it statred to raise; however, from 2008 to 2009 it slightly decreased from 171 to 168. The funding started to increase quite rapigly in 2009 and reached an all time high in 2011. Then there was a sharp decrease so by 2013 the worldwide outlay accounted for 214 billions. The developed countries invested approximately 70 billion dollars in 2007, te funding remained fairly high over four years, in 2009 it atarted to grow and peaked in 2011 accounting for nearly 170 billions. The investment started to diminish in 2011 and by 2013 it accounted for approximately 120 billions. The volume of investnent in developing countries was around 25 billions in 2006, then there was a steady growth in the outlay over a period of six years so by 2012 the amount of money was more than a hundred billions. After a slight decrease in 2013 the investment accounted for nearlly 90 billion dollars. Overall, the dynamics in world total investment and the changes of funding in developed and developing countries were quite similar, for all of them peaked at almost the same year and then slightly fell down, generally, the investment in 2006 was lower than in 2013.
