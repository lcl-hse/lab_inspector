Many people prefer to use air travel more than other ways for moving in different countries. As for me, I agree strongly that government should make laws in order to ban some amount of air travel. 
First of all, airplanes affect to our planet and our nature, becouse work of this machines is a cause of air pollution and global problems. We must to keep the Earth for future population and for our children. 
The second negative thing about air travel is that sometimes airplanes can be in exident and can be crashed. Unfortunately, it leads to many catastrofes, where many people lose their family. 
Besides, every air portes should pay many amount of money for oil. And we know, that not every country has free access to getting oil, and petrol. 
But many people don't think about this problem. Probably, they like to move fast and air travel is the best way for it. Also, they doesn't want to spend much time for travelling. 
In conclusion, I want to say that we must to keep our nature and government can help our population to solve this problem.
