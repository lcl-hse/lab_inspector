Though it is widely believed that prisoning for a longer period of time can lead to a drop in crime rate, some people claim that this is not a sufficient method. The reasons for both opinions are outlined below. It is hard to deny that the stricter punishement is the less is the desire to commit a crime. Once a person could predict that the sentence for his crime might be extremeky long, he has a more difficult choice between a crime and his future, so he is likely to refuse commiting the crime. According to the latest reserch which took place in the US, the states with longer prison sentences perform a lower crime rate. Nevertheless, it can be suggested that the alternative ways of reducing crime such as better education, attention of the society to abnormal actions and increasing morality could help to decrease crime better than the longer sentence. It seems obvious that it is much more effective for the social life to prevent crime than to fix those who commited it with the prison. To conclude, it is definately the case that the success of crime reducing depends on how long prison sentences are, but sentence is hardly the only way to deal with the problem. To my mind, in some cases the longer prison sentence does not solve the problem as it does not fear a person. So, the earlier we start to prevent criminal actions through moral education the better results will be approached in reducing crime.
