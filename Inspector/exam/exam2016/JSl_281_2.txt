The development of social media nowadays creates two different approaches on their main aimes. Some people argue that Facebook, Vkontakte, etc. should contribute to the further sharing of information and knowledge. The others see the main function of such networks in entertainment. In this essay I will consider both points of view. Turning to the first opinion, it should be mentioned if social media keep on developing in the direction of sharing knowledge, it will contribute to worldwide improvements in technologies and prosperity. Information is a factor of an utmost significance today, and knowing the latest developments in other countries is very important in all spheres of life. For instance, shifts in consumer preferencies may be observed from social networks, therefor leading some businesses to changes. Such an approach can be a little bit misleading as the information in such a medium can be misinterpreted as it is not always written in a literally way. Talking about the other point of view, entertainment has become an essential part of our everyday life. I mean, that with a lot of stress all around us there should be left some room for leisure. And in that way social networks help to get rid of the unbearable part of the reality. However, such trate of thinking can lead to more people being considered as social outcast as they do not participate in real life, indeed being absorbed in their devices constantly scrolling web-pages. It also can have a detrimental impact on any economy. To conclude, two ways of thinking on the purpose of social media considered there are both prons and cons in each approach. Personally, I think that we should not put functions under question apart as both information and entertainment are important and can exist at one and the same time.
