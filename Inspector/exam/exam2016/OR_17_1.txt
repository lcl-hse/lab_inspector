The given car chart illustrates changes in the number of children by region for whom primary education is unavailable. It compares the foresaid feature in 2000 and 2012. Moreover, as is shown in the graph, each column is divided by the gender of children almost everywhere. 
There is an evident downward trend. The number of children without access to primary school education slumped during the period under consideration. The changes were more drastical in the South-Asian region, where only 1/3 of the children who didn't have access to education in 2000 did so in 2012. 
The allocation by gender shows that in 2000 much more girls were deprived of education than boys. In 2012 these numbers became practically equal. Moreover, in South Asia more girls had access to education than boys. However, in Africa such a downward tendency in the percentage of girls without accss to education cannot be noticed.
