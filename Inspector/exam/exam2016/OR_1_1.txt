The given chart illustates an overall decline in number of children without access to primary education in three regions within twelve years from 2000 to 2012. 
To be more precise, the above-mentioned decrease was not the same for each of three regions, while the number of children without access to primary education felt down by 23 millions of children in South Asia, the same figure for the Rest of World region decreased only by 7 millions. It is also worth noticing, that the general declining tendency is correct for both boys and girls. This time the most abrupt changes accured in South Asia too: the number of girls and boys decreased by roughly 17 millions and 6 millions for girls and boys, correspondingly. 
To sum up, the chart gives a spotlight on an overall declining trend in number of children without access to primary education within twelve years.
