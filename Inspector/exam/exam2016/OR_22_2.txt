There are a big problem refer to air pollution and global warming in the world. There are many reasons and one of this reasons is air travel. Nowdays many people use air travel and it is important that government introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I agree with the following topic. I think that the global warming and air pollution are a big problem and we should do everything to solve this problem. I knew that there are many companies in the world searching ways to solve the problem. Many aircraft manufactors thinking about about this problems and they can solve the problem using new technologies and constructions. I think that the problem we can solve with decreasing flights. If the aircrafts which can move 1000 and more people, it could be a solution.
