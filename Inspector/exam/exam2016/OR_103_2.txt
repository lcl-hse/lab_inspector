It is commonly believed by people that travelling by plane should be reduced, as it is extremely harmful for environment. However I do not agree with that point of view because there are a lot of other sources of both air pollution and global warming. It would be easier to cope with them first. First of all it is impossible to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure because nowadays people have a tendency to visit as much countries as it is possible. There are no other ways to visit other continents, because travelling by water is extremely expensive. Not all people can afford it. Moreover travelling by plane is the fastest way of visitiong other cities and countries. No doubt that different business organisations have its partners overseas. Without planes business will definetely die. However a lot of people claim that air travel cause air pollution and global warming. In my opinion great numbers of factories, enormous areas with garbage, traffic jams are more harmful for environment. I strongly believe that it is easier and cheaper to cope with these problems for both simple people and governments. Moreover today professionals create very modern and environmently friendly planes. Our environment is not polluted by such kinds of planes. As a result air travel is even profitable for our planet, people and business. In conclusion from my point of view it is not a right decisiont to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. There are much more other disastrous things which can cause air pollution and global warming. Getting rid of air travelling is not a key to solve that problem.
