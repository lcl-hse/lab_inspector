It can be not argued that the life would be better if the crime is being reduced. But what should be done to reach this effect? Some people think that the solution of this problem is to give very long prison sentences. Others suggest another ideas. What alternatives should be chosen? For my opinion, the best way to stop crime is killing all catched criminals. First of all, if a person successfully commited a crime, he or she can repeat it. But after death, there is no chance to do it. As for my country, prisons are very uncomfortable so after them people become cruel and evil; they can easily, behave in an appropriate way. If the period they spend in prison became longer, this effect will be only more destructive. The other reason is that not enough harmful punishment make people not to be afraid of being catched, so these can easily risk. For example, Andreas Breyvic killed lots of people and got a room in a "luxury hotel" with plenty of food and access to the Internet. Many poor people would like to be on his place, because they do not have goods. The criminals (first of all, murders!) must be harshly punished. That should be done not for them, but for other people who will become too frightened to do something illegal. Another argument us that keeping a person in prison costs a lot. These money can be used more effectively; for instance, for helping to poor, on free education and medicine. The people who have never done any crime pay the taxes and give these money to the who did - not a very fair system, isn't it? To conclude, I think that prisons are a mistake practice. The criminals must be murdered, as it partly done in some great countries, such as USA and China.
