It is widespread information that currently air travel is very popular as the way of transport and it dramatically influences on pollution and global warming. To my mind, government should introduce some laws that will reduce quantity of unusefull flights for business and leisure. To start with, there are many private flights owned by rich people that transport few passangers and have luxurious furniture and design on the board. It is no more that irrational usage of resources to let such kind of air travel exist. Moreover such flights spend a lot of disel which poison the atmosphere. It would be better to introduce some taxes for private air traveling. The second reason to reduce the amount of air travel is to cut the number of free places on the board. There is the information that many flight companies sell not all of their places, so flights are only 80% fulled. However, there are a lot of people who would buy tickets at a lower price. Companies can introduce actions the day before flight to sell all their places and reduce consumption of energy. As the result pollution and greenhouse effect will cut down. The third down is a huge quantity of old flights that need to be renovated, they do not use latest innovations in bio-energy. Big energy helps to safe atmosphere from global warming. To sum up, there are many reasons to introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel. It's a common knowledge that many flights are unnecessary, so it would be better for government to pay attention to them and introduce some laws.
