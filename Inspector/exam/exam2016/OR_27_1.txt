On the chart we can see the changes in the number of children without access from 2000 to 2012. 
There are six calloms which show information from thee regions (from Africa, South Asia and rest of world) in two period of time (2000 and 2012). 
I want to say that we see decrease of children without access in all regions. The biggest changes happened in South Asia. There it decrease more then in three time (from 21,6% to 4.6% of girls and 11.1% of boys). And in the other world this figures is 12.8 per cent to 7.6 of girls and 10.5 per cent to 7.7 per cent of boys. 
Overall, I would like to say that the number of children without access decrease all over the world. However, in south Asia this process the most successful.
