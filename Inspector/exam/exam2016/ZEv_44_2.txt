These are so many vechicles in the age of technical innovations which influence on our environment in a load way. Air travel also provides the significant air pollution and causes global warming. Should the government accept laws to decrease the amount of air travel? In this essay I want to give my personal opinion on this subject. 
On the one hand, most of people nowadays use air as the fastest way to go whenever they want. The services which contributes air travel are becoming more cheapy, and tendension is increasing. If we take some regulations, it will cause the 'wave of unsatisfied people'. 
On the other hand, we have to pay attention to our nature. We should always take necessary regulations to predict the enormous problems like global warming and air pollution. To my mind, all of us take responsibility for our environment. The statistics shows that situation is becoming seriously as never before. 
Overall, the government should take regulations in air travel to make the world more safe. What can be important than mother nature?
