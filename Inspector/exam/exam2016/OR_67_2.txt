"It has been estimated that travelling by air cases many problems such as air pollution or global warming. Some people think that it's obvious to reduce the number of air travels and that governments of different countries should introduce laws to make it work. I personally can't agree with this statement and I have some reasons which prove my point of view. Despite air travel contributes to air pollution and global warming nowadays it's impossible to reduce travels by this kind of transport, because each person has the right of freedom of movings. Everyday millions of people use airplanes to travel around the world for different purposes: for business, leisure or others and sometimes they need to use it several times a week, for example. If governments reduce the number of flights, it will be impossible for people to realise their plans for vacations, to make business in the other countries and many other serious problems. That may resulted uncalmleness in society, which supposed to be very serious problem for the government. What is more, many people live their homes to work abroad, so they need to travel by air just to see their relatives and families. This kind of law will also enable them to realise their movements. There are people whose opinion is completely the opposite. They think that the great amount of air travels affected the air and the environment and one and only way to solve this problem is to introduce new laws. But I personally can't agree with them because of the reasons I've mentioned. In my opinion the solution of this problem can be found in new technologies which will help to make flights not so dangerous for the environment. To sum up, it's seen that the problem of air pollution is debatable. It's possible to solve that problems in different ways.
