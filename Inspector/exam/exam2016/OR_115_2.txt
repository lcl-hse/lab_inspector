Nowadays, adult people spend a lot of time on working and earning money. In comparison with past generation the main goal of making a family has been changed to wish of making a well-paid job. On the one side, parents provide their children all needed staff, but at the same time there is a problem of shortage attention to their children. Many people argue that today our society has a developed institutes, which provides high-quality childhood. For example, when parents work their children go to the garden or school, where they communicate with adults, who can learn tem different things despite of parents. So people suppose that it is more than needed for happy childhood. Moreover, modern people tend to focus their attention not to emotional aspects of family (love, care, help), but to the economical area (expensive toys, the best cloth). This is the reason cause parents from the past have a difference with present. I suppose that less of time, which spend children with their parents leads to misunderstanding problems between new generations. Furthermore, people find shortage attention as an important impact on criminal sphere, because children have more time to be alone, so they demonstrate "free-behaviour", such as rude communication or stealing money. To sum up, family have been changed since past decades. Modern parents have to pay more attention to their children by well done time-management or chosing more appropriate job, in this way people could give a exciting feature to their children and themselves.
