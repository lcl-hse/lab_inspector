The graph illustrates the percentage of boys and girls without getting primary school during 12 years. 
Overall, from the graph description we can see that in Africa, South Asia and Rest of World there is a tendency of declining primary education. For example, in Africa, there is a lower percentage in 2012 in comparison with 2000 (approximately 45 million in 2000 and 32,5 million in 2012). 
To add to this, we can resume that in any region in 2000 there are more girls than boys, who do not access a primary school (in Africa 23,7 million of girls in contrast with 20 million of boys, in South Asia 21,6 million of girls in comparison with 11,1 million of boys and in Rest of World 12,8 million of girls in contrast with 10,5 million of boys). 
However, after 12 years situation has changed and the percentage of boys, who do not get into primary school in South Asia and Rest of World in comparison with girls became different (in South Asia 5,1 million of boys in comparison 4,8 million of girls; in Rest of World 7,7 million of boys in comparison with 7,6 million girls).
