Throughout the last couple of years there has been a lot of controversary around the air travel. Some say that a lot of air travel is unnecessary, others believe that we cannot couple without it. To begin with, it is obvious that we are not able to normally line without air travel. Every day millions of people travel across the sky to visit laked ones, to attend business meeting on conferences and simply make a vacation in different country. Beside that tons of goods and products of great variety is being transported by planes every single day. Moreover, dozens of people are working in this segment of the market. If government will introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel, people will lose the only way to travel last and comfortable to any distinction, goods would not be delivered to buyers and many people will lose their jobs and may to earn for living. However, aircrafts can cause serious problems. First of all, planes countable greatly to air pollution that is a burning issue of own time. This pollution, prodused by planes also cause the greenhouses effect that is the main reason fro global warming. Noise pollutionis other problem because residential occurs near the airparts due among the loudest places in towns. The level of sound there often cause the headaches and other decrease. In conclusion, I want to say that my opinion, some laws restricting flights should be introduced by the government. But it should not be too radical, because as I stated above, a lot depends from air travel.
