Both line graph and bar chart provide information about the money spent on renewable energy in the world over the period of 7 years. They shows the features both od developed and developing countries and clearly shows that they are not equal at all. Overall, it is easy to see from the line graph that the quantity of money spent on this kind of energy by a world total takes its minimum at just 100 $ Bn and reaches its peak at the feature equal to 279 $ Bn constantly increasing from 2006 to 2011. Then by 2013 it becomes slightly lower. According to the bar graph, the features of developed countries are significantly higher then ones of developing countries (so the highest rates for developed and developing countries are approximately 180 $ Bn and 105 $ Bn respectively. However, it can be seen that while the rates of developed countries are increasing almost the all shown period (from 25 $ Bn approximately to, there is no such tendence for the rates of developed ones. This is the end of my report.
