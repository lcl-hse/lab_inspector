Problems relating the air pollution in general have always been one of the topical issue all over the world. How should we deal with them especially when it comes to air travel. How do they affect us? 
Are there more positive or rather negative effects in all that? Discussing these controversial it is impossible to give one well-defined answer for sure. 
On the one hand, it is obvious that airplanes have bad influence for environmental. We need a clean air every day for live, and without access to clear air we will die. Probably nobody would argue that it is an disadvange. On the other hand this attitude may cause a lot of concerns among people who believe that air travel give the ability for comfortable and fast change location in the world. 
In conclusion, I want to say that it is impossible to estimate all the benefits and drowbacks of air pollutions and air travel.
