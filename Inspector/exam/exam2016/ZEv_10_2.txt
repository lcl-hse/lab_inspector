Nowadays, the problem of air pollution and global warming takes first place in the list of humanity problems. Some people believe that air carries are responsible for air pollution more than car owners and factories and governments should take measures to reduce their harm to the atmosphere. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion. 
First of all, there is a huge demand in air travels. There are a lot of aims air carries can help to reach from private needs like desire of holidays or want to visit relatives to delievery of goods from another part of the world. Obviously, it is impossible to decrease the number of air travels. 
Moreover, greater contribution to air pollution and global warming lies in car owners and factories hands. Every day people themselves destroy atmosphere using private transport instead of public. It should be noticed that in modern world a lot of families have two and more cars for each family member. Therefore, there is a huge air polluting effect produced by ouselves. What is more, there is no need to discuss about responsibility of factories for damaging atmosphere. 
In addition, there are not so many rich people in the World who can afford using their own flights. Thus, I cannot agree that a lot of air travel is unnecessary as private flights are only one of some hundreds of public ones. 
In conclusion, there are some other spheres to control by governments but air travels. Everyday human's actions can make a greater input in destroying atmosphere and causing global warming. Therefore, governments should focus on creating laws to control people's usage of private transport and factories' pullings in rivers and air instead of reducing the amount of air travels used.
