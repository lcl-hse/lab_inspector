Nowadays more and more parents go out to work together and children forced to spend time on their own. This problem has become urgent, because it cause a lot of different problems. Now, lets discuss the main reasons of phenomena. There is nowhere more evident that women desire to be more independent in modern world. First of all, it is financial independence. If woman split up with man, it will be more easy to adapt to the world again. What I mean is she will have good job and experience. She do not face the problem of unemployment. Also it is belived that all parents want to supply their children with all best equipment and education. So they need a lot of money on it. If husband cannot earn necessary amount of money, his wife should searchs the job and help the family with money. For example, it is hard enough to buy a new flat with two rooms. In the past flat with two or more rooms is not considered essential. As far as I concerned, this cause a lot of problems. First of all, it can lead to the involvment of childs in criminal and bad behavior. Child spends more time on the street. It is more probability to meet the bad company and begin to smoke of drink. Also it might be stealing some food from shop or taking drugs. It is common knowledge that this phenomen can cause the feel of isolation. Child might think that he or she is not loved by parents and they find the job more interesting. It can lead to a great range of psychical illnesses. For example, my friend lose weight in order to attract the attention of her parents. She fel very lonely. To conclusion, I would like to underline that we should take into account this problem and begin to solve it gradually in order to avoid negative impact of this phenomenon.
