Today we can see the major tendency in big corporations: they are interested in opening their companies in Third-world countries and employing local people as workers. Such trend cause a debate between those who believe that such policy has lots of benefits and their opponents who claim that it has a lot of problems. To begin with benefits of such economical trend I would like to point the fact that the third world countries have a biggest mount of human resources while the number of working places is dramatically low. By having business organization these people are capable of having a work place and steady job. It is well known fact that when PH Industry opened their firm in Malasyia the 20 mln of people started to work here. In addition to this fact it is obvious that giving a job for locals cause the rise of educational level in country. Furthermore business which is ruined in developing countries lead to improving the level of social and economical environment. On a contrary people who are against such policy claim that as a prevaluating number of citizens are low-educated they cannot stands for their rights which sometimes tend to hard conditions of their job. For instance, there are a lot of evidence of rough behavior of managers and strict rules. Another major problem is that local people do not have protection from the authority and becoming harmless against any kind of unjustice. All things considered it is closer that running business in poor countries has a great impact on life of local people and the situation in this country. However, governments of such countries need to beware the case of unappropriate behavior toward local workers and give them guarantees in safety and respect.
