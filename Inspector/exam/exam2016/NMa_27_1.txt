The bar chart contains data about uneducated at primary schools children by gender in three regions: Africa, South Asia and Rest of World by two years 2000 and 2012. 
Generally, we could clearly see that in all observing regions amount of children without acess to primary education are significantly dropped down from 2000 to 2012. 
It also easy to note that South Asia had the most signly downward trend for number of illiteracy boys & girls from 21,6 million to 4,8 million for boys and from 11,1 to 5,1 millions for girls. 
Meanwhile Africa and Rest of the World regions had particulary equal trends in schools developing. I should mentioned that Africa in 2012 were equal with South Asia in 2000 by total amount of illiteracy children. 
To sum it up, I should say that in all regions we can see positive trands in literacy developing. Especially in South Asia region.
