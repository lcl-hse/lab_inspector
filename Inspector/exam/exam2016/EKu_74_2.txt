As the international business prospers, many companies decide to develop their business in poorer countries and employ local workers. To begin with, the first advantage is a contribution of an international business to local economy. In developing countries unemployment is a frequent problem, and employment of local people rises the wealth of population and of government itself. But not only the host country gets profit: an employing company makes profit on cheap working power, because employees from poor countries are ready to work for less only to have a possibility to earn some money for living. To continue, there is a range of disadvantages. The first one connected with a treat of a company to local employee. As a fact that is eventually spoken about in mass media, local workers are often treated badly during the working period. They do not get enough sleep, the conditions they work at do not correspond to stated norms and rules. When locals are given a place to live, it often has not got proper heating and conditioning system. The similar situation is in Russia with migrants that work almost for free in harsh conditions. Furthermore, companies from abroad do not economy on local environment, which is being polluted by unecological production materials. To conclude, it is evident that company has got profit to employ local workers, while local employees, from one hand, have an opportunity to gain money, and from another hand, they frequently have to struggle through harsh working and living conditions.
