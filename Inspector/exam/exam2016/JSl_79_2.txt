In modern world, it is a widespread practice of many companies to move their businesses to the developing countries some people are considered that it is not profitable, others claim that it is worth doing. Personally, I think this moving has more benefits than disadvantages. To begin with, moving to the poorer countries companies can save their resources because these countries usually have better tax climate. So, their opportunities to release new products. Furthermore, it is very cheap to employ local workers, because they usually want to do any job. This caused by the problems in economy. This can be provided with the example of Apple - company, that based big proportion its production in China, where labour is very cheap. The last but not least, developing countries sometimes try to help business to be more integrated in the world economy. For example, in many Asian countries government encourage foreign people to start new business and and to exchange experience. However, in some cases this moving has the backwards. First of all, companies, that share their business introducting it developing countries can easily harm the local culture, as globalization leads to the interfering of the stronger culture to the weak one. Moreover, mentally of people, who work in that business is also essential. Chinese of the manager to control their work. Taking into account all the above said, I conclude that in my opinion this problem has more positive aspects, as the whole world is becoming more integrated, that reduces the differents in standarts of life.
