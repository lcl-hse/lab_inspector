Air pollution and global warming are the most significant environmental problems nowadays. And, of course, air transport has a really large influence on such problems. But at the same time different kinds of prohibitions, which governments can introduce today, cannot solve such environmental problems like global warming and air pollution. I really believe that in our modern society we can find others factors and ways to cope with this problem. First of all, there are a large amount of different factors, which have influence on such problems. For example, some factories also can destroy our air. As I know in Magnitogorsk some factories uses a very dangerous chemical recources. Secondly, in our casual life we can use different kind of chemical. For instance, every morning girls or women prefer using cosmetic divaisis. In conclusion, there are a lot of different factors witch may have influence on such environmental problems like air pollution and global warming, we don't have to talk only about air transport.
