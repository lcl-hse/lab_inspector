Traveling by plane impacts on the atmosphere destructively and causes various environmental problems. It is considered that authorities have to prohibit using such way of changing a location by special laws, especially, if flights for fun or for not very vital work. I do believe that this idea is not as effective as other variants like developing new technologies for planes. First and foremost, the globalisation is coming and the world will not be running as it is now without opportunities that people are given because of fast flights. Businessmen need to have such sort of transport to meet with the international partners and rule their companies that can be located in different countries. Consequently, without flourishing economic area that is provided by that enterpreneurs and also air companies the standards of life and likely to decrease dramatically because people will loose their jobs, some goods in some regions will not be available and so on. Moreover, citizens can rebel because little of them will encourage such policy without tourism and prospects for development in business. Having said that, governments should protect the environment and stop the air pollution. Global warming and other disasters influence people noticebly. So that authorities have to provide special rules that prohibit machines which dangerous wastes are over norms and invest in researches in this sphere of science. All in all, inspite the fact that global warming and air pollution affects human beings negatively. I am totally sure that the efficiency of laws which reduce the amount of business and leisure flights will not be as high as it is necessary to protect the environment.
