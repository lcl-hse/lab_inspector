In recent years business had a vast development in different areas: from making shoes to assembling computers. Unfortunately this development was affected in developed countries which are situated on the North. It had variety of outcomes. It has risen the standard of living in such regions and has risen wages of average citizen of the North countries. This means that business for the most of the international companies started to cost much more expensive and they started to move their business to developing countries. That has caused a lot of arguments about morality of this movement. Some people are sure that companies have not to move their business while other consider that it is the only way for living in the North countries. Primarily, there is a specific fact that the more one company spends on production the more it overprices it's product. So, if they move their business back to their countries, their product would cost much more than if it was made in any developing country. Furthermore, spending less on the workers from the developing countries allows spending more on the workers from the developed countries. One company should take care for their motherland in the first place than for some poor country and the movement allows to increase economical level by recruitment teenagers from their countries. However, the main argument is that companies employ workers from poor countries for the lowest price they can. It causes bigger poorness level and then it makes a cycle. Anyway, such employment helps us to improve our economic. If one country wants to increase it's economy, the Japan's example could be very useful and it would stop employment workers for the lowest price. Of course, it's a pity that they have to live this way but it is their choice. So, I think that advantages outweigh the disadvantages in a great extent.
