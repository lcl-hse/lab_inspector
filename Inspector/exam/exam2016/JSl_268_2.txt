Of course, there are many different opinions about social media and many of people always will discuss this issue opinions from this statement. In my opinion for each man these social media can have different purpose. For one man Facebook is an entertainment and only for another man it can be of knowledge and information. It is depend on man. And think that we should ask each of them about social media, what is, for example, Facebook privetly for him. As for me, the second media, firstly, it's the instrument of getting information. Also use it to have a contact with my friends relatives and others. And finally, I use it sometimes in entertainment purpose. In conclusion, I want to add that there is no the answer for this question: "What is purpose of social media is right?" I think that we should ask each of people, because each of them have different need and aids.
