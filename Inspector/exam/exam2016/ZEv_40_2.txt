The issue of disastrous effect of air travel on environment has become a matter of great concern for the government in recent years. To my mind it is impossible to shorten the amount of air travel nowadays. 
First of all, as the world becomes more and more globalized and international connections are turning to be unbreakable it is impossible to avoid constant travelling from one point to another to prevent economic and political meetings. Air travel remains to be the fastest and most comfortable way of travelling. Moreover, other means of transport also have a damaging contribution to environment. For instance, oil traces from ships make a thousands of sea life die every month. The same can be noticed in car travel as its gases make air pollution an alarming issue. 
It is hard to disagree that our consuming habits have brought us into a conflict with nature making it is close to collapse. Thus, goverment should do something about it, including stimulating technical progress in replacing the old means of transport and communication with the new one, more environmental friendly. It is also possible to promote local leisures activities in order to shorten the time spent airplanes fly crossing the planet. Moreover, the most dangerous role of this contribution is played by damaging engeneering, manufacturing, water pollutions and so on. 
Overall, I assume that inspite of the fact that government can't prevent society from travelling by plane in todays reality, still it is possible to make the situation better not only from technical part but also from popularizing environmental friendly society, economy as a whole.
