The observed chart illustrates the numbers of children which don't have access to primary education in different regions. The greatest number of such children live in Africa. In 2000 almost 45 millions children didn't study in school: 20 millions boys and 23,7 millions girls. To year 2012 total number decreased to 33 millions with 14,5 millons male and 18,2 m female children. But it still remains bigger than in the rest of the world in summary. In 2000 South Asia the number was slightly less than in Africa at the same time. 33 millions children without access to school lived there with huge number of girls that reached 21,6 millions and 11,1 millions boys. Then there was great decrease and in 2012 total number was less than 10 million and number of boys extended girls one with 5,1 millions and 4,8 millions. All other regions except Africa and South Asia had less children without school attendance in 2000. Total number was 23,2 millions and after remarkable decrease it was 15,3 millions in 2012. By gender, male number decreased from 10,5 to 7,2 millions and female from 12,8 to 7,6 millions. To sum up, according to statistics we observe a good tendency of decreasing numbers of children without school access so we can surely say that level of education increases in regions and worldwide.
