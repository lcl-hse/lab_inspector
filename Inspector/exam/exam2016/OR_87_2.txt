Global warming and air pollution is a big problem for humankind nowadays. Air travel contributes to this problem but it is also the fastest and easiest method of travelling. Can governments introduce laws that will impact people's ability to go from place to place and give permission only for business and leisure? I think not. From my point of view, governments cannot do that because it will brake international laws (at first) - an ability to travel wherever person wants. I do not think that global warming is not important, I think that humans should find another way to improve situation and this path do not have to be this radical. For example, people can use more environment friendly materials and liquids (gas) to make that impact less negative. People used to travel a lot since it became cheaper and a lot faster than years ago, but it is not very good for environment. Of course, people should not travel less, they need to find other ways to do it without negative impact. I think that trains nowadays is almost as fast as planes - it can do almost 900 kilometres per hour! It is very impressive, I think. My point of view is that government should not introduce bad laws - they need to make trains more appropriate-cheaper, more confortable, less noisy - of course this will be expencive, but it will be useful. To sum up, I came to the conclusion that people need to find a decision, but not by introducing laws that brake another laws - people need to use another, not that radical ways to make air pollution and global warming less big and still be free and have an ability to travel at any time.
