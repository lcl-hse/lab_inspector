Nowadays we have deal with many problems and issues in our world. And reducing crime is not an exception. There are many people who think that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. These people have defenetely key for solving this problem. However, others believe that there are better solutions for it. And I enter to this number. I don't think that giving longer prison sentences will solve this problem. In my opinion it will give opposite effect and we have to clearly research this problem before giving solutions. I believe that there is more better solution of it. In my opinion, we can reduce crime if we think, that which type, which quality of education we are giving for children. I think that all start from family and school. Every person in our society have to understand that he also take part for solving this problem of for creating some new problems. I believe that good education and sensible actions can reduce crime. 
To conclude, everybody in our society have to know that with his participant we can reduce crime and solve many other problems. Our world needs and solve many other problems. Our world needs for gathering and discussing about solutions of these problems.
