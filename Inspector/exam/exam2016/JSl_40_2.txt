The question whether governments should restrict air travel policy for professional and leisure use or not has been debated recently. It is agreed that there is a clear colleration between traveling by air pollution and the global warming, but governments must not narrow humans' rights to use whatever means of transport they want. The essay will discuss is traveling by air so insignificant as it stated. Air travel is the fastest and easiest way to reach any destination and everyone should have equal access to it. New technologies are developing and if someone wants to get the best of it, she should have a right to do it. By introducing laws to reduce the amount of air travel governments this way would say that one can travel from Russia to America and one can not. Also that kind of laws would influence the trade activities and chains around the world, because many of companies require planes to deliver some goods and services to customery. Moreover, we all highly demand for international products and this way we would get it rarely than usually. Nevertheless, the air travel truly contributes to air pollution and global warming, but many other transports do so. For example, trains and cars are dramatically polluting, so government should ban it also? Undoubtedly, no, humans have a right to use all modern facilities of our world. To sum up, air travel among other transports influence the environment of the world, but government cannot introduce some laws to reduce the amount of it. The other way to decrease the amount it use and pollution is governments' investment in innovation and educating programmes.
