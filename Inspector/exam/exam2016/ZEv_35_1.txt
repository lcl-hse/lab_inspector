The given graph depicts how the number of not having access to primary school education kids has changed over the decade from 2000 to 2012 by sex in Africa, South Asia and the Rest of world. 
Overall, the main tendency that can be clearly seen from the bar chart is that the number of children without access to the first education decreased in all three regions. Another significant feature is that more girls than boys do nor attend primary school in the whole world. 
It can be seen that the largest reduction was in the South Asia from 32,7 to 9,9 millions of children. The highest percentage of kids without primary education goes to Africa. Although the number of African children has fallen to approximately 33 millions stayed the biggest one. 
What is more, in 2000 all regions had more girls without access to primary education but in 2012 the number of them was less that the number of boys in the South Asia and the rest of world. Only Africa saved the statistics (more girls than boys) with 18,2 and 14,5 million representatively.
