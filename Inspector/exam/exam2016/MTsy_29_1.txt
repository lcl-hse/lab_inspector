The bar chart demonstrates how many children had not access to primary school education by 2000 and how the situation changed during the period from 2000 to 2012. Data is sorted by region and gender. 
The most demonstrative, prominent feature at a first glance is the prevalence of children without education in Africa. By 2000 Africa had twenty millions of such boys and about twenty-four millions of such girls, what was a bit more than it was in South Asia and doubled more than it was in all rest part of World by the same year. Besides, it is worth noticing the trend that both in Africa and in South Asia (similarly with the rest world) there had a significant decline in the number of chidren who could not attend elementary school. Thus, by 2012 South Asia had uneducated children less than Africa had and the rest of World had (approximately five millions of boys and the same number of girls).
