Person, who wants to share or find useful information can search for a needed public with information he is looking for. Also, in social media there are many people, who share their reports about famous people, news, developments and etc. while other people can find these reports in Facebook and Vkontakte and get new knowledge about whatever they want. On the other hand, in our modern society every one has smartphone or computer. People who use these devices can play in different games on it.

Moreover, these social media provides different publics with funny pictures, images as known as demotivators.
