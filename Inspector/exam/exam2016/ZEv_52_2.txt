It is argued that ecological problems are one of the most vital, which include global warming and air pollution. There are a lot of reasons that can be grouped into one term - human activity. Atmosphere has been polluted by air travel for the last decade. There are some policies that should regulate and reduce the number of air travel. In my point of view, there is no right to limit people to move all over the world. In this essay will be discussed balanced between ecological problems and human right. 
Nowadays we can observe globalization. A lot of people has the Internt to exchange their cultures, views and information. Thus migration has quickly scared for the last years. It became essential part of modern people's life because of technological progress. I think that government should not regulate human movement because it is not interruption of rights and private life. If government choose groups of people who can travel there would be discrimination for the rest people. In addition, a travel reduce related with business and economic declining. 
In my opinion, there are a lot of ways to solve ecological problem. The prime example is to invest to develop alternative ecological sourse. Besides, government can introduce laws to air companies' standards not to reduce the amount of air travel. In conclusion, I would like to say that the air travel reduce is radical method to solve air pollution problem. As is observed there are more civil alternative ways.
