To begin with, the bar chart illustrates the amount of boys and girls of three different regions: Africa, South Asia and Rest of World, which were not allowed to attend a primary school between 2000 and 2012. 
Firstly, it can be seen from the graph that children which had not access to primary education in all three regions became lower in 2012. As for Africa, approximately 5 millions of boys and 5 millions of girls had opportunity to attend primary schools. 
In contrast, in South Asia the proportion of girls decreased at 16,8 millions and standed at the rate of 4,8 millions in 2012, but the number of girls in the Rest of World become lower (7,6 millions) than in 2000 (12,8 millions). The number of boys in the this region levelled off too and was equal 7,7 millions. The amount of children who did not have access to primary education and South Asia 2000 is equal.
