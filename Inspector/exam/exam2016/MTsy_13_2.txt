Nowadays people are eager to save their time and due to this fact they tend to use different technologies sjch us environmently-unfriendly ways of transport to satisfy their needs. There is no doubt that it is an enormous harm to our nature and I dare say that to some degree air travel should be limited. Lets delve a little bit deeper on this issie. 
Firstly, according to research by scientists, wich claim that it will be hard to breath without special equipment within 120 years on our planet, government should take immedeate actions to solve this problem, in particular, make a limit for it's own country for air flights per year, because air transport is the most polluting way of travel in comparison with other ways of transport. 
Secondly, people who have money and power take their own private airplanee only because of comfort, and they travel by their own with pilots, not wish stending the fact that such plain cun tuke hundreds of people. And that is why goverment should make a threshhold of people per cur plane. It will sufficiently stop the pollution. 
However, if we look at opposite arguments we will see that to some extent air travel can come in a handy. I dare say that some professions should be allowed to use air transport. For instance, there should not be any ban for doctors that use airplanes in order to help people because it is the question about life and death. 
In inference it should be mentioned that some laws for reducing the usage of air travel for business and leisure must be developed by goverment. But they must take into account all exceptations.
