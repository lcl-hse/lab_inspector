Nowadays, more and more people are concerned about their safety abd the safety of their close ones, as the crime rates appear to be very disturbing. One of the most frequently proposed solutions for that is to prolongue prison sentences, while the apponents of such measures argue that there are ways of dealing with the problem with more humanity. Both points of view have their fair reasons to exist and be meditated upon. On the one hand, a fear of punishment for centuries has been the main tool in our fight against criminality. Punishment is the reason for following the law even in Abrahamic religions. Of course, it had enough time to show itself relevant, and it also has deep psychological roots. It is not a coincidence, that most of the world law systems are based on that ancient fear of taboo. However, we now are living in the age of reason, and we have a great heritage of Renaissance thinkers not only to study it as a history, but also to use it everyday. Humanism, one of the main achievements of the era, teaches us that a human being is the highest value of this world. We cannot just treat men and women as beasts, trying to train them with such primitive methods. Besides, great discoveries in the field of psychology of the 20th century show us, that violence and punishment would only raise anger and the desire to revenge. Since the World War II there have been developed many alternatives, based on teaching, talking and empatic behaviour towards the prisoner. To conclude, the matter under discussion is, of course, controversial, and in such cases there is an urge to listen to both opinions. Personally, I would argue the less brutal approach to the prisoners, as we all must be given a second chance. To establish long prison sentences means to give prisoners more reasons to continue their crime actions. A new humanistic methos of fighting the crime rates might be one of the greatest achievement of out time.
