Nowadays a lot of children do not see their parents quiet often because of work. They spend time together just on weekends or very late at night. This situation was different in past when parents were always close with their children. There are a lot of reasons why parents stopped paying so much attention to their children now. Firstly, nowadays adults think more about job and career than people in past. They want to have a better job, high salary and a good business career. Parents forget about their children and they are ready to spend 24 hours a day at their working places. Secondly, more parents hire babysitters to take care of children. They understand that children are under control of a professional that is why they do not need to pay more attention to kids. Finally, it is quiet difficult for adults to find well paid job which is close to their home. Parents need to work in another part of the city to maintain their children and give them expensive education and clothes. Sometimes they more to another city to earn more money. Unfortunately all these reasons can cause big amount of problems. Parents start losing connection with their children. Children do not want to listen to their parents. There is a huge misunderstanding in such families: parents understand faults very late, when their sons and daughters are old and mature. And such old children do not want to keep in touch with their parents and forget them very quickly. To sum it up, children's and parents' connection is very important nowadays. Parents should not forget about their kids and spend more time with them than at working places.
