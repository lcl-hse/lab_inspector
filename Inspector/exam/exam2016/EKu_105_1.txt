The graph showen in the task gives information about investigations in renewable energy between developing and developed countries and all around the world in the time period of 8 years ( 2006 - 2013). As for developed countries, the highest level (about 180 $ Bn) of investment was in 2011. The biggest amount of investment (279 $ Bn) in the world was also in 2011. Developing countries reached their peak (about 110 $ Bn) in 2012. The same level of investions, which was about 100 - 102 $ Bn, was noticed in both developing and developed countries in 2007 and 2009 (in developed countries) and in 2011 (in developing countries). The tendency of investment in renewable energy in developing countries was that it had been rising slowly since 2006 to 2012 ( 25$ Bn in 2006, 48 $ Bn in 2007, about 65 $ Bn in 2009, about 70 $ Bn in 2010, 100 $ Bn in 2011 and about 103 $ Bn in 2012). But then in 2013 it decsreased to 85 $ Bn. Increase in investment in developed countries was seen during the period from 2006 to 2008 ( 75 $ Bn in 2006, 102 $ Bn in 2007, 120 $ Bn in 2008). After 2011 year it slowly went down to 140 $ Bn in 2012 and 120 in 2013. As for investment in the world it slowly increased from 100 to 168 (from 2006 to 2009 year). Then it increased to 279 $ Bn in 2011 and decreased to 250 $ in 2012 and 2014 in 2013.
