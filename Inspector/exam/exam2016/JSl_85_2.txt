In our days there is a lot of bog companies, which have their offices in different countries. Some of them develop in rich cities, countries, anothers one business in a little and poor places. What the reason do they have? Firstly, it should be noticed that the international companies share their products, services and open largest possibilities. These companies move the customers on the side. For example, if the Coca-Cola companie opens their offices in Nigeria, employs certain local habitants and the prices for their production will have been moved to more comfortable, then Coca-Cola companie become more popular in the world, because they support poor countries. Secondly, against this point of view there is a lot of disagreements. Offices in developing countries could have a lot of finances problem. If big companie move to the little developing country, this companie will jump in the "finance hole" and this sharing will become a crysis for officers in these countries. Like wise employing people might lose their jobs and in this case products of such an international companies should lose their benefits by customers. Overall, I can say, that this way for business could be really dangerous but it also could win this struggle. Population of poor countries could love this services and, in the future, when countries will become one big customers group, which will be ready pay any price to buy products from the companie then has supported. It is really discussing question and in my opinion it will be really hard to find an answer.
