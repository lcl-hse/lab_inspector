The businessmen now are very clever, and they have enough knowledges of PC, to control their business whith partners with PC, but there are any problems, that must be solved during the meeting of businessmen face-to-face. 
At the other hand, there is type of businessmen that don't believe in anyone, and they like to do all theirselves. They don't trust PC too. "And if you want to catch the mind of your partner in best way, you must have a meeting with him face-to-face". These words said famous Russian businessman Roman Abramovich in one of his interviews. So if some businessmen will stop their business, because it will be uncomfortable to wait for some short process in business one week. So in the begging their business will deacrease and after some time they will close business. And it is bad for global economy: many workers that worked on them wouldn't work. Partial conclusion is that it's bad fo economical process.
