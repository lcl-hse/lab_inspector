Nowadays, air travel is very popular kind of transport. But it is used too much, so the Earth has some problems with air pollution and global warming. Governments should introduce laws or taxes to decrease the number of travelling planes. And I fully agree with them. First of all, I would like to mention that in the moment in the sky are thousands of planes. And all of them pollutes air with CO2 and a lot od different dangerous gases. Governments should involve taxes for pollution on airlines and on companies who produce planes the Airbus and Boeing. So, because of these laws, they will cooperate with each other and try to make new type of engine or fuel. Thus these innovations will help not only to air industry but for all transports at all like usual cars, buses and even to transocean ship. The second reason is hat planes flys above town cities, national parks and lots other natural areas. So, people cannot forget about these facts. Planes' emissions not just pollute water and air. They pollute water, kill animals, destroys forests and so on. And also people have. We everyday breath with polluted air and drink polluted water. To sum up, I would like to say that governments from all over the world have to think about this big problems that planes are making. Governments should introduce laws and taxes for air industry. And this introducing will change a lot in life of the Earth.
