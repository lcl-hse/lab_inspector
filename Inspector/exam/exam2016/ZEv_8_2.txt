The invention of airfly and further possibility to travel through the air changed our world into a global village, where the frequency of air travel has become an issue. It is considered that this type of travel pollutes the air and has become one of the causes to global warming. I fully agree to the extent that quantity of air travel should be lowered by government. 
Firstly, unnecessary air travel should be prevented. Nowadays the possibility of air traveling with no point and earning a private airfly has become some sort of luxury. For example, some rich people travel by air when the alternative traveling (eg., by train) is cheaper and faster. 
Secondly, there are lots of other causes to global warming and air pollution. Furthermore, in order to slow the process of polluting the air, number of air travels should be reduced. An alternative way of air traveling should be found, for example, electrical engines. 
To conclude, I believe that in order to prevent or at least slow down the process of air pollution, the quantity of air traveling should be reduced by government.
