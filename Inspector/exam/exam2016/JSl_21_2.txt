Nowadays air travel became very popular. It is a great invitations which help people easy reach different parts of the world. Bur some people believe that it cause global warming and other dangerous consequences so governments should reduce the amount of air travel. I disagree with this points of view for a number of reasons. To begin with, all means of transport affect the environment and cause a pollution. Cars, trains, busses have a dangerous consequences if they are used very much. So, I believe that the problem is not especially in the air travelling. For my point of view, air traveling has a lot of advantages and cannot be aliminated. Firstly, it is the fastest way to travel from the one point in the world to another. There are no substitutes for it because something the way. Can get you a week while the air plane can get to the point for a couple of hours. Secondly, it is really save transport because there are a lot of securities and police officers in the airports checking your lagguage and bags. Moreover, restrictions are not the exist of this problem. Government should give more money to scientists and invatators to create an ecofriendly fuel for airplanes or make another means of transport faster and more convenient. All in all, there is a secious ecological problem of air pollution and global warming. But governments should not restrict the air travelling because it will not reduce the air pollution as much as they expect. People will began using another means of transport that will cause even more pollution then it was before.
