In nowadays, many people believe that only longer prison sentence can help to reduce the crime. But other people try to find more effective humanistic way of reducing crime. 
On the one hand, people think that if they make prison sentence longer many future crimes will be reduced because burglar, murder, kidnapper and others will think twice before make a crime. For example, people can just afraid to make a crime, because if they do it and policy caught them, they will spend all their life in prison. In spite of this fact, many people for which making a crime is a "lifestyle" never stopped to do it. 
On the other hand, other people advise better, alternative ways of reducing a crime such as special moral subjects in school, increasing government payments for homelesses and so on. For example, special moral subjects in school can helps pupils understand which actions are right and ligal and which are not. Moreover, increasing government payments can helps to reduce a crime, because many people just stopped need in food, water, clothes and so on. So they don't need to make a crime for their surviving. 
In my opinion, I absolutely agree with a second view, because I think that it is not right way to reduce a crime, people just have not to want to make a crime. In conclusion, I believe in this world without crimes.
