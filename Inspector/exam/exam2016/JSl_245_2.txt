There is no doubt that plane is the most popular way of travel. Some people are of the opinion that the number regular air travels should be cut because of great influence on global warming and air pollution. I can partly agree with this issue. it is evident that air travel influence on such global problems as aor pollution and global warming because there is no developments that can reduce this influence and tackle thos problem yet. Nowadayas, some people are sure that it is unnecessary to utilize planes at such amount, there are a lot of ways of travel. For instance, trains can be used fro those trips. It is more harmless for environment. Trains are also more convenient and less risky than air travel. Thus, plane is not onle one way of travel. To my mind, air travel has been used mostly, last years because this way of travel is faster and sometimes cheaper that others. No doubt, that it has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming but there are a lot of other things that influence on environmental more than air travel, however, they are not so forbidden. For example, cars are dangerous for environment too, but their number is not decreased, I am sure that there is np need to introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. It won't solve environmental problems as well as it is predicted to be. To sum up, air travel contribute greatly to global problems but the amount of car travel shouldn't be reduce by laws. Governments should pay their attention on more important spheres now such cars, forests cutting and so on. If they tackle all these problems now, we will be able to ensure good future for our planet, because only complex measures can help.
