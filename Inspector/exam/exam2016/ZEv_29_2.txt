Nowadays, moving by air is frequently being claimed as one of the most essential reason of global warming as a result of air contamination. Thus, there is a spread point of view that the number of flights should be controlled by the authorities. As far as I am concerned, this opinion is partially fair. 
On the one hand, air crafts always cause harmful effects towards ecological conditions. Indeed, planes and helicopters leave out specific gases which can threat the environment leading to a global temperature rising. Consequently, governments should definitaly reduce time spent on air by taking appropriate measures. 
Moreover, there is a significant problem that a special ecologically safe means of transport still does not exist. In this way, the main aim of the authorities should be not only limiting air travels but also contributing to the invention of new mode of transport. 
On the other hand, businessmen and tourists are able to use only planes in order to move higher distances in shorter periods of time. Unfortunately, this still remains the only way of travelling while special transport means are not invented. 
To sum up, I reckon that governments should definitely maintain limits of time spent on air. But they should likewise help inventing ecologically safe modes of transport.
