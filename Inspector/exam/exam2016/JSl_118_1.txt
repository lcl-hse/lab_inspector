Today, there is a problem when some international companies chosen poor developing countries as a place setting up a business. They leading all deals from there and also employ local workers. Some people think that it is normal and that is the best way to set up your own business. Others, on the contrary, think that there are more disadvantages first of all, the main benefit of this plan is high income, which companies can get from low salary payment. Because of few work places people agree on any jobs in developing countries. Second is low prices, which can help to avoid economical payment for company. In contrast. There are lot of disadvantages, such as expluation of people's who works for low salary, or other reason is monopoly, when sometimes company monopolise the countrie's economic and start to produce low quality products, which is influenced on all prices in some sphere and government losed from that. In my opinion there are more disadvantages because companies, which move their business in developing countries is avoid to paying money to government country from where they moved on, which have negative impact on local economic. To sum up, there are more disadvantages then benefits and consequently international countries should lead their business in local countries.
