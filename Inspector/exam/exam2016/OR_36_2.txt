"What is the best way to reduce crime?" There are many different answers. The most popular is to give longer prison sentences. It is effective in sence that criminals are in prison and therefore have no opportunity to do something bad. Someone who whants to do crime will afraid. But many people thinks that this is way is not so humanic and effective for the following reasons. At first supporting prisons is very expensive. But this is not main reason. If someone stole the car at 16 and then we give him 20 years of prison then when he live it he will be aggressive and more criminal because did not get education and so on. And he lived 20 years in criminal atmosphere. For example my father stole the boat when he was 20 years old. Judge gave him 10 yers of prison and when he lived in prison he stole another boat. In my opinion we should find other solutions for this problem. For example we can develop special programs of rehabilitation for ex-criminals or improve general quality of life, then there will be less reasons to do crime.
