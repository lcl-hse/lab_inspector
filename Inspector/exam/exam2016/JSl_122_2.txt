It is a well-known fact that these days almost worldwide companies have made a shift to developing countries starting their business there and employing local workers. The more countries will be occupied by international organisations the better world market will work. In this essay I am going to overview the given topic and present any arguments. First of all poor, developing countries need invested and money sources. Of course, the main idea of big world companies to make profit. However, if the industrial field of country is in progress, automatically other parts of live become better. For instance remind all countries where the Olimpic games took place. During the modernization and building period a lot of work sources were included and there were a little developments. The same thing we can see spending of the given movement. Not only local people will be working and stop suffer of unemployment but also a social life and an economic level will rise. Some disadvantages may be covered like problems with teaching. In fact a lot of time and money will be spent for reaching a necessary level of skills of local workers. Also some old factories needed to renovate and changing the diveces and technics items. Furthermore it is hard to manage already an international organisation. It is followed by increasing of staff and responsibilities. To sum up it is a controversial question. In terms of company, that cause of big investments but also high profits. For developing countries I can highlight only positive consequences like new work places.
