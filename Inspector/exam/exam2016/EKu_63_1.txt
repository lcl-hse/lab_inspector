In my report I will describe the graph that shows changes in worldwide investment in renewable energy from 2006 to 2013. It covers information on both developed and developing countries. It can be seen from the bar chart that developed countries always invested more money in renewable energy than developing countries. The biggest sum of money was invested in 2011 by developed countries and was about 170 billion dollars. The sums of money invested by developing countries increased from 2006 to 2012, but in 2013 the number dropped. The tendency of investing money by developed countries is different: from 2006 to 2008 the sum was increasing, in 2009 the number dropped, from 2010 to 2011 the sum was growing again and from 2011 to 2013 the sum was decreaing. Developed countries started investing money in renewable energy in 2006 with a sum of approximately 70 billion dollar, while developing countries invested only 30 billion dollars. By 2013 developed countries have invested about 130 billion dollars, while developing countries have invested about 90 billion dollars. In world totally the number of invested money was increasing from 2006 to 2011 (except for year 2009 when number went from 171 billion dollars to 168). From 2011 to 2013 the sum was decreasing. The most productive year for investment was 2011, when the sum of 279 billion dollars was spent for renewable energy.
