The chart below presents the information about changes in the number of children, who do not have access to primary school education. The numbers are measured by region and gender during the period from 2000 to 2012. To start with, it can be seen from the chart that all around the world girls have much less access to primary school. The number of such girls is near twice bigger than the number of boys in South Asia by 2000 - 21,6 compared to 11,1. However, again in South Asia there is the only change when boys became less educative by the end of the period. Meanwhile, South Asia has the highest changes during the period. By 2012 number of children from this region without access to primary education rapidly decreased from 32,7 to 9,9 more than 3 times lower. The changes in number of girls and boys are also the highest compared to other regions: 16,8 and 6 respectively. To summarize, in all regions the number of kids without primary school education declined during the period. This may be caused by development in education system all around the world, and it is predicted that the numbers will continue to fall.
