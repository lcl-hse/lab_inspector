Nowadays it is a normal practice for modern people to travel. The fastest way to travel anywhere is to travel by plane. But there is one issue that makes travelling by plane ecological unfriendly, one plane pollute air as thousand cars. The questio is if it is beneficial to us, humans to travel by planes or we have to reduce the amount of air travel as it will to a disaster in future. 
I agree with the position that air travel and the usage of planes should be reduced. First of all, the ecological situation on our earth is cticical. We destroy forests which produce oxygen for our lives and which can filtrate and reduce the proportion of harmful gases and CO2 in the atmosphere. And when we travel by plane, we make an extra pollution which can lead to some ozon holes in the atmosphere which can destroy the life on the earth. Secondly, there are thousands of planes in the air each second. Some of them are even without passangers or half-full with them which also leads to extra pollution without any sceme. 
However, some people claim that cars and factories produce much more pollution and planes are more ecofriendly then other transport because there are no so many of them. I disagree with such people because in comparison with 20 years ago, today there are much more planes and plane manufacturs still want to better the characteristics of their products but not to reduce their emissions. 
To sum up, I am sure that we should reduce and controll air travelling because it is too harmful for our planet. I think that the best way to reduce emitions is to make eco-friendly planes.
