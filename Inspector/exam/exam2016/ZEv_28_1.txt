There is a chart that gives us an information about the proportion of children which have no access to primary education. Moreover, it shows the quantity of boys and girls, that's why we can analyze the question of sexual discrimination also, The first aspect, which I'd like to say about, coinsides to the issue of social and economical development of African and South Asian countries. In 2000 the number of children without access to primary education was approximately the same. Although Africa had an absolute first place, it didn't changed the deal coordinaly. The main feature is that after 12 year left, the number of such children is South Asia minimized in several rimes. So, the Asian region have the smallest number of boys and girls without access to primary education, when Africa stayed on the last place. 
Another main feature in this chart is showing us a proportion of boys and girls. So, in more developed regions, such as South Asia and Rest of World, in 2012 this proportion is approximately equal. It means, that we can stop talking about a sex discrimination in this sphere. However this problem have saved in Africa, where the number of girls without education is much bigger, than boys. 
In conclusion, I'd like to say that South Asian countries showed an efficient progress in sphere of children education, and it made them more potential for future development.
