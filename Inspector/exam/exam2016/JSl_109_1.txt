The diagram below gives information about in worldwide investment in renewable energy between 2006 and 2013. We can see that here compared developed and developing countries with world total. Firstly, let consider the world total line. It is clear from the chart that it increase between 2006 and 2011. And the graph changes from 100 billion dollar to 279 billion dollar. However, between 2008 and 2009 the graph declines 171 billion dollar and 168 billion dollar respectively. And from 2011 to 2013 we can see that the chart decrease. And investment in these years were 279 billion dollar and 214 billion dollar respectively. Secondly, I want to consider that bar plot. According to the graph the highest point of investment in developed is approximately 180 billion dollar in 2011 while the highest point of investment in developing countries is approximately 107 billion dollar in 2012. It is clear from the graph that the lowest point of investment in developed countries is 75 billion dollars and in the same time the lowest point of investment in developing countries is 25 billion dollar in 2006. Over all, it is clear from the diagram that investment in renewable energy of developed and developing countries lower than world total.
