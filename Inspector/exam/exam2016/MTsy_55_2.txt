It is considerate nowadays that travelling by air is a reason of air pollution and global warming. Some people think that there are air travel which is not necessary and governments should ban some big amount of business and leisure travel by air. 
On the one hand there are many advantages which include air travel. For example, business trips spend less time while using airplane rather than train or bus. Also in some situations it is necessary to use air travel due to the fact that there is no other way to get in place. Furthermore, the quality of roads make leisure trip unsafety when you choose bus. 
But on the other hand there are many situations when people choose plane for trips which take one or two hours. In this occasion the government should pay attention to this and make some laws to reduce the amount of pollution caused by airplane. Furthermore, one hour of working airplane spend more fuel than bus, so that the air is polluted by air-plane has more refclection on global warming. Moreover, the comfort of airplane attreact more passengers than train which has less less effect on the air. Due to this government should rise taxes on airplane which travel on short distances to make travelling by train and bus more convinient. Also the extra money from air travel fees should be spent on quality of bus and train service. 
To conclude, I would like to say that government should ban unnecessary air travel and take into account the popularity of other ways of travelling. But in some situation airplane is the best one.
