Nowadays our society faces to face with many ecological problems such as air pollution, water pollution, increasing the number of deseases, which can lad to global disaster. And some people think that air pollution is caused by using airbuses. While others cannot agree with it for many reasons. I think, that there are a lot of other reasons for air pollution and global warming, air travelling is only one puzzle of all picture. And we should seach the other way to cope with its problem, but introduction laws to reduce the amount of using airbuses is not suitable for modern society. First of all, airbuses are the most convenient, cheapest and fasten kind of transport. And if governments introduce laws that reduce the number of air travel for business and leisure, it could cause social disaster, "bum" among people. The history gives us a lot of examples of radical reforms and many of them leaded to awful consequences. Moreover, there are a lot manufactories, factories that provide all kinds of pollution more than other things. I mean a great number of waste, toxic components of their technologies. And there are a lot of examples when owners of these factories do not buy necessary equipment that can help to avoid ecological problems. And scientists did many researches in this area and said that airzoles which are using in our everyday life all over the world contribute a great to air pollution (about 15% according to the results of researches). To sum up, I want to say that, of course, using airbuses a lot of time has its drawbacks and has a negative influence. But we should not forget about the main factors of air pollution and global waming at all; toxic wastes of factories, using some things in our everyday life. And people should try to cope with it without introduction unsuitable laws in the sphere of social life.
