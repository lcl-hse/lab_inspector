Some people consider giving longer prison sentences is the best decision to cut down the number of crime. Others argue the alternative ways exist. I would like to present both advantages and disadvantages of these opinions. First of all, let us imagine what would be if all of the prisoners would have life-long sentences. Obviously, there would be less criminal activity because of the strict punishment. However, those who broke law could not be given a second chance and would never be forgiven. This point is rather important nowadays due to the popularity of humanism ideas. Secondly, there are some more ways that can help to avoid criminals. For instance, placing CCTV cameras in the shops or putting more light at the streets. Nevertheless, no one is sure these ways would stop criminals. In my opinion, the government should provide safety using both longer sentences and other ways but so it step by step. There is no need to leave criminals in prisons forever, but it would be better if we care of our safety more. All things considered, it is necessary to add that during the last years the crime activity has been reduced.
