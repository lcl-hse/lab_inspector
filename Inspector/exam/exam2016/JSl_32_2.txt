In modern world there is a tendency of air pollution by air travelling. Some people believe, that governments should introduce laws for reducing air travel where it is unnecessary because lots of business and leisure travel is the main reason which provide air pollution. It is undeniable, that huge amount of air travel make a great demand to nature and planes in the air are one of the main air's pollution causes. I absolutely agree with the first statement about pollution but I can't agree with the statement that governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. Millions of cars and fabrics pollute air more then just planes. So I don't believe that situation with pollution should be solved by this way. There are two solutions for this problem with air pollution and global warming. The first one, is to change sources used for making oils for planes or change technology of producing this one. It may help to clean gases, which pool to the air while air traveling. The second solution is to change the constructions of planes and invent a new ones more bigger. It helps to save, time and to decrease the amounts of flight. In conclusion I want to emphasize that reducing the amount of air travel is not a solution, it just a way to decline the global pollution for a some time. But air pollution and global warming will not stop.
