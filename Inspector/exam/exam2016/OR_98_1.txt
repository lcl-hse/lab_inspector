The chart reflects changes in the number of children who do not have an access to primary school by region and gender during the period from 2000 to 2012. The general trend is that the number of children from different regions and of different gender who have no possibility to get primary education has reduced during 12 years. There was a substantive decrease in the number of boys and girls who are not accessed to primary school in Africa from almost 45 millions to less higher than 32 millions of people. As for South Asia, it must be mentioned that there was a dramatic decline for more than 20 millions. The situation in the rest of world is not an exception. More than 5 millions of children got a possibility to study in the last mentioned period. Turning to gender criterion, it is seem from the graph that more girls than boys got an access to primary education in South Asia and in the rest of world. However, the proportion of both genders are equal in Africa. To conclude, governments of all countries have been providing successful primary education policy in the period from 2000 to 2012 that allows many children to go to the first form.
