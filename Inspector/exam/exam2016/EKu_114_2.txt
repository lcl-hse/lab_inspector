In recent times the issue about the workplaces in developing countries is very serious. Many world-wide companies move their places of production into developing countries, for example, Africa. People need to know, if the benefits of this development outweight the minuses. Moving companies to other poorer countries has a lot of pluses for international companies. Firstly, companies have a lot of benefits from such steps, because the salaries in developing countries are lower and there are more workers. Secondly, there are less taxes and charges for companies, making the production of their goods more cheap. Thirdly, developing countries have fewer laws about the environment and all kinds of pollution, which helps companies produce their goods with less losses. However, moving to poorer countries can cause a lot of serious damages for the local people and culture. To begin with, many children are working for international companies, whose plants are located in developing countries, because they need to earn money for their families, receiving damage for their heath and chilhood. In addition, companies can pollute air, water or other natural resources, which are essential for local population, and they even can destroy some unique natural or historical masterpieces. Moreover, companies use very cheap labour, do not providing locals with medical insuranse, compensations or vacations, which makes them poorer than other population in industrial countries. In conclusion, it should be noticed that there are more disadvantages of moving international buisnesses to developing countries, because it damages badly local people. Personally, I believe that such trends should be reduced and made illegal. Hopefully, in the future all workers in all countries will have the same rights, and then companies could move their businesses to every country.
