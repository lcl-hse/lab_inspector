The presented bar chart illustrates the amount of money which was spent by developed and developing countries for renewable resources of energy, while the line graph gives the statistics for the world. The data is varied by years and given in billions dollars. First and foremost as it is seen from the diagram, one can assume the significant increasing of total world investment renewable energy from 2006 to 2011. 2011, for instance, amount of investment rocketed up to 279 $ bn. Therefore, in that year the developed countries also reached the peak above 150 $ bn. Secondly, developing countries invested more and more money in renewable resource, during the period from 2006 to 2012, but in 2013 the mentioned parameter declined on about 10 bn $ and reached the 90 bn $. All things considered, the overall trend is that developed countries invest more money in renewable energy than developing countries. However developing countries almost get to developed countries by 2013. So, total 214 bn $ of investment in that year consists almost equally of money both of 2 kinds of countries (for about 100 $ bn from developing and developed countries).
