It is not a secret that in our modern world more and more companies have very high incomes which means that those companies can expand their businesses from country of origin to other countries and even continens. These acts influence on the factor that companies organize their businesses in developing countries and advise job, positions for locals. In this essay, I am going to consider both pros and cons of this fact. First and foremost, when international companies go to poorer countries, they provide a huge number of new working positions. For instance, one of th most popular band of sport goods, Nike Inc, gives about 5000 vacant jobs, for Thai people. Thiland has a very high unemployment rate, so it is important benefit for this country. Moreover, international companies help the economics of poor countries, because they build there new factures with high-quality equipment. I guess in the future, these countries will have significant economic progress. However, there are some disadvantages. A lot of developing countries such as mentioned Thailand, India and others have many natural parks which are hones for different animals. In case of fumes from factories, some species became endangered. So, the international companies are actors who destroy environment in developing countries. To sum up, there are advantages and, of course, disadvantages of international companies' expanding. I believe that humans can cope with negative side of this problem by applying experience of developed countries. For example, companies could use renewable sources of energy like electricity from sea and ocean waving instead of cheaper sources like petrol and gas.
