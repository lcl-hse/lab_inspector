The issue of how to develope your bussines such as international organisation, has always been quite important to its owners. Many people think that it is necessary to move from developed, reach countries to developing ones while others suggest that this kind of decision will brings no advantages. First of all, developing countries gives you an opportunity to save internationalle buiseness from being quite expensive because of its non-installed economic system. Besides, local workers want to have some income which their own country cannot offer to them. Moreover, if the new country where your business will be situated, is just developing, then it is more easily to make it more successfull in a more easy way. However, there are people who have the opposite point of view. They think that moving from developed countries will be the worst decision for international company's owner. At first, they ask themselves if there are, indeed, strong reasons for such a changing? The answer is no because the buiseness was developed in its 'native' country, the company has all the stuff which is need for the good work. To conclude, it seems to be evident that it would be more advantages if the owner of company stays in developed country in whis international buissenes was developed successfully.
