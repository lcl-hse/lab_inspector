As a result of high-intensive development of market economy the competition between many international companies has become more harder. Many new organisations try to involve in the market, so many international companies move their business process to some poorer countries in aim to save more money for the new technologies, for example, Tahiny into account. I strongly believe that this is a good business strategy which has many advantages. As a rule, many companies try to save money by moving their business to another developing country and employment local, workers and this is the main advantage of such way of doing business. The majority of local workers has low paid job and they continue to work, because developed and developing countries has different standarts of paying for job. So these workers believe that their salary is good, while in developed country it can be not enough for one particular worker. Another advantage for companies which has moved their business is to make sphere of their influence bigger. Moreover, it is possible to them to enter on the new market areas and find new key consumers. Talking about the disadvantages of such strategy in business, we have to mention about several risks. Du of the mot important risk here is to reduse the quality of products. A new work force may not provide good results, so this will be affect on the whole production. Risk of unapropriate quality leads to another risk of loosing a big part of consumers on your own area. This fact is literally unpleasant but according to the statistic workers from poor countries do their job quite well because they do not have an opportunity to find another stable position in their labor market.
