Some people think that air travel plays a big role in air pollution and global warming and noting for prohibiting unnecessary air travel, such as business and leisure travel. To my opinion, it can all be true, air travel undoubtedly add some part of pollution in the air. However, is it so huge and important to reduce some air travel? On the one hand, it is a reasonable statement, that such a big amount of air travel we have nowadays is not that necessery and can be cancelled by the government. Aspecially, when we talk about some private business trips. People who use private plains can travel with other passengers by first class for example. Besides, we do not need to travel by plain if we can do it by train. There are such trips as Moscow - St Pitesberg, which people do not always should make by plain. On the other hand, talking about pollution of the air and global warming, we must understend that air travel is not the most important problem. There are lots of things which influence pollution much more then air travels. We should think about resolving such problems as lots of cars, factor and so on first, and not about prohibiting air travels. I do not think that after canceling some private business travel the problem will become less. In conclusion, I would like to say that it is a very important problem and everybody can see it from different sides. However, before making any decision we should carefully study all the ditails, all pros and cons of this deal. It is a really important thing for people to be able to travel by plain, that is why we should do everything not to let us to loos this opportunity.
