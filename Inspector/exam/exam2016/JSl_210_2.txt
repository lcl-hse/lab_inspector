There is an argument that setting up the harder conditions for criminals can be reduce crime in general, but I am not sure this is the only right way, as many people think, I will describe both of views on the essay. People, who prefer the first position, think that if human who is going to make a deal and of the law will know about longer prison sentences, he will bot do this. So, they are particularly right but most of cases happen because of psychology and innormal nervous system. However, humn who killed somebody or make any other hard crime deal must be urgent isolated out of the population because he is dangerous for people. As for the second group of people, they are sure that if human made a mistake one in the past and moved out of the law, it is necessary to give him an opportunity to stay on the right way by living with normal humanable conditions out of freedom certainly. For instance, Norway's and Sweden's governments use that method, so prisons in these countries seems like a well - designed modern flats with TV and access to the internet with some restrictions. In conclusion, I would like to point out that not only prison sentences has influence on th government crime competitions. However, I personally more argee with the second opinion, because I believe that it possible to recover the human on the right way by alternative methods instead of make prison sentences longer and it is more effectively, but many challenges in this competition are still awaiting their solutions.
