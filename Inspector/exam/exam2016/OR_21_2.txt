Nowadays we face with very significant problem of air polution and global warming. Air travel plays a great role in this issue because of burning a lot of fuel during the flights. So many people think that governments should decrease the number of unnecessary traveling (for example for business and lisure). However I strongly believe that in our age of information the rapide of movement between cityes is extremely important both for busimessmen and others, so we cannot to reduce amount of air travel without significant economical conseqencis. 
First of all air travel is a fastest way of movement between cities. So all of us neet it because we haven't got enough time to travel by bus or train. For example somebody have holidays and want to have relax in other country - he cannot do this without flyghts. More over such method of problem decision provides to reduce in foreign investments which help to economical growth. It will hapen bause foreign companies should control their founds and do it fact, however it becames rather difficult to do if governments force them to use alternative transport that as much slower. So such law inithiative deglohalize world economy. 
To sum up, it is clear that global worning and air polution are crusial issues of all of us. However as I see government should find another ways to tackle this quastion, because air traveling is very significant part of our life. It is helpful both for business and others.
