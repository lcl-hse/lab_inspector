Nowadays, many international companies move their business to poorer, developing countries and employ local workers. Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages? On the one hand, there are some obvious disadvantages in this economical process. Firstly there is doubtless harm to the local environment caused by the plants and factories of these companies. Secondly, the economical laws of a poorer country may not be as well developed as in richer countries. Thus foreign businessmen may exploit these facts to get more profit, which may harm local economy and society wealth still being legit. Thirdly, the working conditions for the local inhabitants can be quite severe and poorly paid, which would be considered a crime in some other, more developed countries. On the other hand, there are some advantages as well. For example, it is a good chance to integrate those poorer countries into international trading and business process, which may appear to be crucial for their further development. This process also provides working places for the local citizens, giving them chance to work and earn some money for living. Another important point is that some of those businesses may provide those poor countries with the goods they could never or hardly get before, like clothes or shoes for example. All these facts are doubtless vital or a country's development. Which outweigh another is a difficult question. It seems that we should judge only in particular cases, not in average, since this depends on great number of facts and circumstances. Therefore, only time and practice will help us to figure it out.
