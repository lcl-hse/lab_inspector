These items it was noticed the tendency, that a big part of international companies began to remove their business to the countries of the third world. To say another way, they move of developing countries and give the work places to the local. In this essay I will try to look through some pros and cons of this process. Firstly, having transferred his own business to poorer country, employer can easily find cheaper workers who are ready to bring income to his company. This way, it is quite possible to decrease the level of poverty in this country and move its economic situation more stable. But there is a high possibility, that there are few qualified workers. With big background who will be able to work hard. That is why the company can't increase its income and can be destroyed. Secondly, not only company's moving let us owner wide the working network around the world, but also he can get nesessarily connections which will mark his company among the others. Moreover, if the company uses earth's sources in the production, it is more likely to found out new ones in another country. But if the company has moved. For example, only one year ago, it easily can meet with problems with the government or the different local companies with the same direction of the work. To conclusion, I would like to say, that the way of company's moving has more advantages than disadvantages. So if I were an owner of an international company, I would probably open it in the developing country.
