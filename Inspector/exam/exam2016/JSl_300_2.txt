Nowadays social networking sites are an essential part of our life. Due to the huge influence of these sites on the society some people argue that they should provide educational content, while others claim that their aim is to entertain. In this essay I will cover both points of view and give my opinion. On the one hand, the necessity to share knowledge via social media sites is undoubtable. These days almost everyone in developed countries has an access to the Internet and frequently visit social networks. Thus, instead of wasting leisure time on useless pictures and videos people can develop their minds reading or listening, for instance, lectures. Another argument the supporters of this idea use is that a considerable part of social media users are children and teenagers. As a result, it would be helpful for them not to get distracted from the process of education by jokes but to know something new that will be useful for them in real time. On the other hand, social media are an important resource that helps people who have worked or studied all day relax and forget about little problems. Indeed, there people are tired from their daily routine and to continue get knowledge after a hard day. One more argument in favor of this point of view includes the idea that there is a freedom of choice on these websites. Unlike television, where it is impossible to watch a favourite show of the convenient time, social media sites visitors are generally able to choose the option they want. All things considered, there are a plenty of strong arguments supporters of opposing opinions provide. Having said this, I am included to think that both points of view are reasonable and the only remedy is to combine informational and entertaining content of social media sites.
