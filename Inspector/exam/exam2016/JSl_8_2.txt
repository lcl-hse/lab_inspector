Nowadays air travel is becoming more and more popular. There are people, who argue, that this type of traveling has been proven to contribute gratly to air pollution and global warming. Some people want governments to introduce laws to reduce the member of business and leisure air travel. I don't agree with them. 
I think, that the procent of advantages is bigger that disadvantages. I believe, that factories polute our Earth much more than air travel. The fact is factories works all days and all night and they are bigger than planes, that is why they are more dangerous. Thirdly, the number of cars, which are polluting the world every day, are increasing day by day, so air travel is influencing global warming less than cars, that are everywhere. 
In addition, I believe that governments should not take part in air travel. A lot of people work in this area, if governments reduce the amount of air travel, big number of workers will need to find new job. My next point is developing countries, which are survive only because of tourism. Tourists can visit new countries, that are far away from them without air travel we will not see a lot of beautiful places. It is important, that businismen help people to work, survive and live in the countries from the "Third world", they can open business their and native people can work in new places. 
Summarizing everything, I want to say, that all people are different and they have different points of view, but I deeply believe that air travel is one of the neccessary thing people need and we do not reduce it.
