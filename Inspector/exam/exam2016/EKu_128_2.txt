Crime is a very serious problem in our days. Most of people think the best way to reduse the number of criminals and violence is to keep people in prisons for longer time, however not all the human beings think the same, so there are those who contradict to this point of view. On the one hand there are benifits of giving longer prison sentences. Staying for a long time in prison makes convict think about the harm he inflicted. If the prissoner commited a serious offence such as murder it takes a long time to bring his mentality to healthy level and to be sure that he is reeducated (he will not do such harm anymore). By the way longer prison sentences will act as an example for those who want to commeet the crime. On the other hand,taking care of criminals takes a lot of money. In developed countries they are kept in very good conditionds. However, they live on money that pay other people to government as taxes. Actually, it may mean that longer prison sentences, higher taxes. In my opinion, it is important to look at alternative methods. Many countries have lengthy prison sentences, but crime has continued to increase throughout the world, so it is clear that this is not completely effective. That said, long prison sentences should remain for those who commit serious crimes such as assault or murder, as justice for the victim and their family should take priority. To sum up, everything should be dosen and the government should create very severe conditions in prisons in order to prevent people think of the crimes.
