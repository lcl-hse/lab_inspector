There is a notion that air travel has become one of the main sources contributing to an increase in air pollution and global warming. Because of that, some people argued for the introduction of laws which would fighting regulate the extents for travelling either for business or leisure purposes. While I can partly agree with this line of thinking, I believe other options should be considered as well. To begin with, it is certainly important to restrict the amount of air travel to the places where it is possible to build other routes connecting them with other countries, like railway stations and various sea paths. For example, a highly modernized train of a technically safe ship could transport people to where they need without accompanying chemical dangers inherent in travelling by air. Moreover, trains and ships are not as risky in terms of accidental deaths compared to planes, which, as numerous reports prove, continue to be as unreliable as ever. However, one cannot deny that some destinations are inaccessible or tremendously difficult to reach without using planes. It would be detrimental to the world economy to limit or ban these types of routes, as this would certainly slow down economic processes. The same applies to the sphere of tourism, as there are a lot of countries whose financial well being depends on the state of their touristic affairs which, in turn, are built upon multiple air routes, Instead, efforts should be applied in the way of improving current technologies harming the environment and minimizing deleterious effects. In conclusion, I would like to argue that a massive, indiscriminate restriction of air travel could likely bring more harm than good. Governments should invest in developing other routes between regions and promote them as better, safer options, as well as finance more environment-friendly engines or mechanisms. In all cases, any limitation of air travel should be thoroughly considered before being enforced.
