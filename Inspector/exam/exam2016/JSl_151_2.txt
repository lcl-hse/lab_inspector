Economic system include individual companies as well as government projects. First one plays an important role in employment system if every country but today, according to worldwide situation, many international firms and companies make their businesses rather often in poorer and developing countries that in developed countries. This essay discuss advantages of this development. First of all, we can say that such changes can lead to the upward trend in businesses results as it is cheaper for international companies to make their projects in poorer countries. They can buy cheapest buildings for their business and employ local workers because such workers can't afford high salaries as most of them are not good educated. Moreover, for companies many local workers can be a kind of additional power for their usual workers. It can produce good works results during the business process. Another side of this development is that such changes could produce unemployment in centuries where such companies based before. As a result, there could be a bad situation in whole economic system because there might be not stabilized countries. By the way, non-educated workers cannot produce the product of high quality as they do not have enough knowledge for that. In addition, I would like to say that I am not an expert in this topic but it is clear for me that there are enough advantages and disadvantages of this development. The main advantage of this development can be supported by real example of Nestle company which nowadays has based their parts of producing products not only in developed but also in developing countries. As it was said from experts such company has great results in products producing industry because they replace their business in developing countries as well. This is only one good evidence of such development.
