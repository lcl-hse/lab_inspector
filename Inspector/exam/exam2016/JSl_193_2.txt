The given statement says that most people see no ways in reducing crime except giving longer prison sentences. From other point of view, there are alternative ways. On the one hand, law breakers should get longer prison sentences so that they understand that made something bad. In addition, social community should relax from crimes. If lawyers won't give longer sentences, law breakers return to people and continue making whatever they want. Prisoners should be teached a good lesson. On another ways to cut off crime. The main point is that the law breakers should be punt in inconvenient situations. Hence, next time thy will better thing before breaking a law. For example, crimers can be made to work, build something and even clean streets. These works will help to recover lawbreakers to normal life. From my point of view, there should be a balance between long prison sentences and alternative ways of reducing crime. Those who made crime should be kept in tail for all life. Others, for example thiefs, shouldn't be kept in prison, but should do something helpful for society. Such laws will help to return them to normal life in a short period of time. In conclusion, I'd like to say that law breakers should be judieed more humanly, but cruel and violent ones should get long jail sentences.
