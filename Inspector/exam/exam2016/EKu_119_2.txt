These days the vast majority of international companies move their businesses to developing countries and employ local inhabitants. I personally believe that there is a lot of advantages for both companies and the locals to open manufacturing in countries who need help. First of all when a global company goes to a new countries, especially ones with a poor population, it creates a huge amount of working places. It is known that in developing countries earning money is a struggle. Usually people have to work hard for many hours just to provide their families with their minimal needs. At the international companies they probably will continue to work hard, but they will be get more money than they used to. The amount of money companies are giving to locals is lower than they would have to pay in developed countries for the same job. One more benefit for the business is that they reduce production costs. Not only work force is cheaper, but also the materials from which products are made. Nevertheless moving business to poorer also could have a disadvantage. Business is moved to a different country mostly because the owners want to reduce production costs. Owing to that, they close manufactures in development countries and open in developing ones. What is a loss for one, is a win for another. People who used to work for the company lose their job and become unemployed. They start looking for a new place which takes a lot of time in developed countries nowadays. To sum up, I would like to highlight the fact that international companies benefit from moving their business to developing countries in many ways as well as the locals who get the chance for a better job. However, we should forget about the consequence that appear when companies shut down their businesses in other countries.
