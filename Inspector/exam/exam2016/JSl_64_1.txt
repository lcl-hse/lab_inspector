The graph shows how worldwide investments in renewable energy were changed from 2006 to 2013 in developing and developed countries. Firstly, investments in renewable energy slightly rose up from 2006 to 2011. 2011 was the period when investments were on the maximum point and it was about 279 billion dollars but after that during two years later, dramatically fall. Developed countries have more investments that developing countries. According to the graph, the maximum of investments in developed countries was about 180 billion dollars in 2011, and the maximum of investments in developing countries was a little more than 100 billion dollars in 2012. But investments in developing countries slightly rose up year by year, when the number of investments in developed countries was always different and did not show a stability. Finaly, taking everything into consideration, the main tendency of this graph is the fact that developed countries have make investments in renewable energy than developing countries, but in last years the number of investments fall down, which integrated in the number worldwide investments.
