Also, according to statistics, plains is the most safety transport. The goverment will save more peoples life if they produce move plants. Moreover, usually people want to travel to travel to distant coners of the world and it will very long trip, if they use bus or train. If they use air travel, they do go to necessary place in short time. 
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. For example, it is air pollution. However, if we talk about all transports in the world, then we can see that each of it warm nature. All transports produce different dangeous gases and it is harmful for environment and our health. Besides, nowadays air travel is very expensive. It is bad fact for families with low incomes. 
In conclusion, I want to say that there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of air transport. Every person chooses what he or she really prefer. However, air travel is important transport and the government should't establish laws, which don't let people to travel on plants.
