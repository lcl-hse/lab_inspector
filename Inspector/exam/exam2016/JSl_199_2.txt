Some people think that harsher punishment is the best way to reduce crime, while other disagree. I think that longer prison sentences are no solution to our crime problem. While it is true that soft punishment is insufficient, like $7 time for driving 20 kmph over the speed limit in Russia, when the punishment harsher, the situation is not so obvious. Imagine that you have beside to commit a crime under the risk of 25 year sentences. It is not likely, that year decision is going to change it the new legistation pushes 50 year sentence as a punishment - both of this basically seem to be "forever". I saw an interview with a man, who was sentences to 54 years to dealing drugs in Texas. He said: "I didn't know what the punishment is, because I didn't care - I believed that I wouldn't be caught" . extending the terms is not very effective when they are already long. The other reason is that keeping prisoners costs very much to the society. This includes the direct costs of punishment system to the expayers, the benefits lost, because people in prison are not working, al least productivity, the costs added by rehabilitation after the long sentence, and the poisonous society, that is in prison. This society can easily replace old social links to the prisoners and turn a prison that have mistake once to a true hardline criminal. I saw a police statistics in a magazine article, that so % of people, who were punt into a prison for a small crime once, are thn caught for a more serious one. Overall, longer sentences will hardly reduce any crime while costing a lot of whole society. Solition to our crime should be in increasing crime in avoidance - in order for that man not to think that won't be caugh.
