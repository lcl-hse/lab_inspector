To the 21st century, the risk of the crime has increased as never before, while in the modern world there are a lot of technologies which seem to prevent this. Nevertheless, every day one can hear terrible news about modern killers and other prisoners on TV. Many people, terrified by such information, believe that long prison sentences for law breakers is the best and the most effective way to reduce the amount of crime. On the contrary, others state that it is not the way out and suggest others way for improving the situation. The reasons for both these views are outlined below. Firstly, it is widely believed that some prisoners can run away from the law and the prison as well and they believe that prolonging sentences for them can prevent others to make crime. They want people to learn the lessons on the mistakes of the other people and think that the amount of crime will decreased. Some of them want law to be more cruel to law breakers, for example, they vote for returning inquisition. On the other hand, many of killers and burglars are said to be normal people before having made crime and some people state that the problem is in people's psychology. They assume that there are other ways to avoid deviation, for example, stop watching cruel films, playing some kind of games, start doing some sports, etc. Moreover, they say that people should make serious measures from the childhood of their children. To my mind, the government of each country should pay a lot of attention on this question and encourage people to be cultivee, well - educated and responsible. I agree with those people who say that we shoud avoid watching TV videos with doubdful content, because crime is a consequence of our habits. I hope that in the nearest future some serious measures will be made not only by the governmnet, but by people themselves.
