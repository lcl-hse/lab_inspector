This graph illustrates the changes in worldwide investment in renewable energy during the period from 2006 to 2013 in developed and developing countries and world total figures. Overall, it can be noticed that world total figures mostly depend on developed countries marks. As we may see from the graph. There was a fluctuation in figures of developed countries from 2006 to 2009 and they made up about 70-110 $ bn. Next there was an increase to 170 $ bn by 2011, but by 2013 its marks again dropped down to 130 $ bn. The situation with investments of developing countries is quite different.
