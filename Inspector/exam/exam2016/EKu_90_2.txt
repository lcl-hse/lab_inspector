It is widely known that the price of product will be consideraly lower if it is produced in developing countries. This is one of the reasons why huge world-known companies place their businesses in China, India and other Asian countries. This trend has not only advantages but disadvantanges also. This point raise a question if advantanges cost them. First of all, this process allows a lot of unemployed people, and in India and China, as I know, a huge protion of them, to have a job and to earn a money for themselves and theirs famillies. Secondly, moving of a business in developing countries may decrease a price of a product which gives a chance to increase the number of consumers because more people would afford it. On the other hand, the salary in that kind of fabrics extremely low and employers often do not have any medical insurance or garantee. Moreover, it is widely known that companies use children as the free-labour which is illegal. Another disadvantage of this trend is that replacing all fabrics and factories in Asia and different poor countries companies spoil them. Air and water pollution are considerably higher in this type of countries then in developed, such as the USA or the Russian Federation. Companies also ruins the ciltural heritage of countries and their nature and wildlife. Last disadvantage of that development is elliminating small companies out of the race and competition because they their production is smaller and they have not got the possibility to reduce the price of theirs products. To sum up, I believe that all advantages cannot outweigh the disadvantages when it conserns the humanity and the condition of the Earth. The final price of the product do not cost such price as the safety of the planet and security of the people. I can suppose that if a consumer really need one product he will buy it no matter what the price is.
