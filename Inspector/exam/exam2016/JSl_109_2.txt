Common today agreed that there is the problem with many international companies. This companies move their businesses to poorer of developing countries and employ local emploees. Let consider some benefits and drawbacks of this statement. Firstly, I want to write about some important procs of this international problem. There are some advantages of it. One of pluses is that this manipulation with companies' businesses can help developing countries improve their international level and later transform in developed countries because this companies, wich about we discussed, employ local workers and the level of unworking is decline. The second important advantage of this statement is that the level of concurental decreases because some big and rich companies move their business to poorer and because of it little and new firms with yung and poalstream workers can develop their business. What about disadvantages, there are some important cons of this problem. Firstly, old companies, wich have exosted in the market for a long time, can create monopoly on the goods or services what they products for a majority of people this is not very useful because people would like that in the market will be many goods and services and they can chose one of them withe a brilliant of perfect quality, the second minus is that the economy of the country where company moved busines to poorer and developing country, can decline because one of the important parts of the economy and international policy moved to poorer. This situation is very awful for level in the world of this country. Over all I tend that this situation with international companies, wich move their business to poorer, developing countries, have more advantages then disadvantages. The most important plus of it is that new companies and firms can develop their business on international arena. I find it very important for big countries and for all world.
