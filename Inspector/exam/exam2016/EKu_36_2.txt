Nowadays people face a lot of types of crime in their everiday life. The issue of growing number of crimes is widely discussed. Some people see the solution of this problem in making the sentences in prisons longer, whereas others argue that there should be more effective means to solve this question. To begin with, some people think that the restriction of the punishment by rising the length of sentence could be frightening for those who are up to make a crime. For instance, there is a serious difference between 5 and 10 years of imprisonment. Moreover, a longer stay under arrest provides government workers with more time for improving the imprisoned ones. Finally, if a person is placed in prison for many years it could prevent him from repeating the crime soon. However, some claim that this means is not enough and that more wide variety of solutions should be considered. Firstly, the social environment must be made more friendly for all people. Secondly, the work of policemen must be put under a careful observation as there are a lot of cases when police helped drug dealers, robbers and etc. Thirdly, the help of specialists such as scientists should not be neglected while solving an issue like this. To sum up, nowadays there is still no alliance between both sides in the question of fighting with crimes and both ways of solving the issue of high crime rates have their benefits and drawbacks. Hopefully, in the future there will be found an effective way to use the argumends of two groups for improving the crime situation.
