Right now there is big argument in society about air pollution and global warming, because of the great amount of flights. In one hand, humanity meets a big ecological problem which of course will have an influence on our life in the nearest future. Will people solve this problem before it will be too late or not depend on our behavior right now. So the thoughts about reducing the amount of air travel is kind of logical. But in the other hand it might be not the best solution for concept many solution. The mobility of modern society became a really important part of our live. And it can be a little bit silly to try to stop this global movement. Maybe we should try to find out other solutions to avoid air pollutions and global warming. For example, such as the improvement of our technologies, we might try to find the faster way for transportation which will not influence on our nature. As a conclusion, I think that air travel affecting air pollution and global warming is a really important problem and subject for discussion. But there might be some other ways to solve this problem than to limit air travel in my opinion the best way is in the new technology apportunities.
