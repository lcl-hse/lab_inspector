Nowadays there ere serious environmental problems. Some of them are global warming and air pollution. There is an opinion that planes rise the level of pollution and contribute global warming. Some people think that to solve this problem gevernment should decrease the amount of not essential travels for business and rest. Other people consider it too strict. 
There are several reasons why such measure should not be taken. First of all, most people travel by plane because they want to go to another country and there is no other opportunity to get there by another way. However, such flights might be unpopular and as a result unnecessary for the society in general, for example if it is not a season for going in this country. But those people just probably cannot have a vocation in another part of the year. That is why if a government prohbits these travels, it will be unfair in attribute to such people as everyone has a right to travel. 
As for business, using a plane might be the only way of transportation goods, for instance, as well. In this case a businessman just cannot cancel it. Although, there are some things which could be done to improve the situation. Government could suggest some other more efficient ways of transportation. For example, if there is a little number of things which should be delivered, they could be sent to place where there is enough number of them and after that they all could be transported by a plane. 
To sum up, governments should not prohibit by car travels which seem to be unnecessary. However, they could think of how to make such travels less harmful for the environment.
