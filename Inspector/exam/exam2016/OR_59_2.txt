Nowadays, air travelling is the most popular and convinient way of travelling for the long distance, if you want to achieve your destination fast. But some people believe that planes cause air pollution and global warming and require to reduce the amount of this type of travelling in order to prevent environmental issues. Personally, I agree with this opinion and try to prove it in my essay giving relevant examples. First of all, it should be noticed that in modern world having a plane of personal helicopter became a luxury and the indicator of success. Rich people are travelling by their own planes even on short distances just for showing their supremacy above others. They absolutely ignore how their air trips influence on environment. To my mind the government must introduce high taxes on personal air vehicles. Secondly, a lot of helicopters are used for parachuting. Unfortunately, many parachuting instructors exploaite vehicles of bad quality which must be repaired in order to earn money from people who find adrenaline. These helicopters harmed the atmosphere much more and often became a reason of death. On the other hand, it is considered that in modern society it is really hard to live without wide range of airlines. Authorities, businessmen which must move from one country to another to solve political, economic problems cannot live without their own fast comfortable air transport. They must be mobile due to their profession and personal plane or helicopter is a good way for it. To sum up, it should be noticed that air travel is really fast and convineint type of transport in modern world. But to my mind despite the fact that it is important part of many authorities and businessmen life it should be reduced to prevent environmental problems and atmosphere pollution.
