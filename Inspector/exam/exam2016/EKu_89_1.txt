The information given depicts the fluctuations in the amount of users of Facebook during the period from 2012 to 2013 and the reasons that caused their interest in this particular social network. The first chart illustrates the general trend for both sexes, whereas the second one demonstrate the tendency for women and men in comparison. It can be deduced from the first graph that in March 2012 approximately 150 millions people used Facebook by their desktops, and it made it the most successful year for the network during the whole period under discussion. On the contrary, mobile users were the least active in this period - only less than 60 millions people. However, by the March 2013 the amount of those, who used Facebook by mobile phones, nearly doubled and by this twofold increase almost reached the index of 100 millions. The amount of desktop users was more stable and had only a small decline from 150 to approximately 139 millions. Speaking about the second graph, it can be stated that women are mostly concerned in sharing photos or videos (54%) and seeing funny posts (43%), whereas men are less interested in these features of Facebook (39% and 35% respectively). Such functions as receiving updates and learning about ways to help other are almost equal for both sexes (39% for men and women for receiving updates and approximately one third for both groups for learning about ways to help); nevetheless, women interest in way to help other people more than men - the difference is 10 %. Overall, as it can be analysed from the data provided, Facebook was the most popular in March 2012, and, as it can be observed from the second chart, women use different features of this website more often than men and thereby are more involved into this social network.
