Nowadays lots of people move through the World is by air planes because it is the safest, the fastest and one of the most comfortable ways of travelling. However, there is a problem of global warming and air planes also have got a bad influence on this fact. The question is what the governments should to do. I am concerned that the governments should regulate this sphere but not by reduction the amount of air travel for business and leisure. As for me, it could be more ecological fuel or other ways to make the bad influence of air transport the least. So from my point of view, it is impossible to cut the number of flights in modern life. People are addicted to their time. It is impossible for business men or politics to spend more days to achieve another country - moreover, it takes lots of money and time to make a special infrastructure for travelling without air planes such as terminals, roads and other once. It is much more realistic to spend this money on science and create more ecological fuel that helps to avoid bad results of global warming without reduction the amount of flights. It is realistic because such researches take place today, for example, cars became more and more ecological every year so I believe that air planes are not the exceptions and it is also realistic. Overall, I am agree with the fact of the problem of air pollution by air planes but I tend to think that the most realistic way of solution is making legislation about quality of fuel, not about the amount of air travel for business and leisure.
