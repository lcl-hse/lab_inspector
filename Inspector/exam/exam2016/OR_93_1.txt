There is the graph that demonstrate how much children in different parts of the world had no access to primary school in 2000 and in 2012. The chart demonstrate both the common number of that children and the numbers of boys and girls. The first two graph sticks are related to children in Africa and it is clear to see that the number of children without acess to primary school reduced: in 2000 it was around 44 millions, including 20 for boys and 23.7 for girls, and in 2012 this number is around 33 - 18.2 for girls and 14.5 for boys. The next two graph sticks reflect this situation in South Asia, where we can also notice the decline. 21,6 of them were girls and 11.1 were boys. But in 2012 the number of such children was only 10 millions (4.8 girls and 5.1 boys). This number is also demonstrated in the Rest of World where the common one was approximately 27 in 2000, including 12.8 girls and 10.5 boys and more than 15 millions in 2012, including 7.6 girls and 7.7 boy. All in all, almost everywhere we can't see that girls had less access to education, particularly primary school. Moreover, the common number of children who couldn't go to primary school had become lower.
