To begin with, I should say, that at present this kind of transport has some negative consequences, such as pollution of the atmosphere and destroying the environment. That is why goverments should decrease amount of air travel for several things: for having a rest or for business trips for example. 
On the one hand, I agree that air travel have a lot of disadvantages. For instance, we should care about our native planet and not to allow to damage the Earth. Air travel is the reason for huge ecological problems. For example, air become really dirty and water is not an exception. We should remember, that resources can end. To add to this, global warming in the increasing stage. I am sure plans destroy atmosphere by their waste. 
But on the other hand, air travel have several drawbacks, which cannot be admitted. Air travel is a great opportunity to see the whole world and to know the wonderful secrets of each corner of our planet. Furthermore, from my point of view air travel is vital for people, who want see beautiful sights and learn traditions, customs and history of other countries. Also, I believe, that travel by plan is the most convinient and comfortable type of transport. I think, that air travel economy your time. In my opinion, air travel helps people to develop business, because other countries it is a new people, new views and new connections, which are necessary for flouiishing of business. 
To sum up, I want to underline, that people cannot abandon plans, because of their advantages, but we should not forget about the Earth and the environment. To my mind, we should use air travel if only we have very important reason for it.
