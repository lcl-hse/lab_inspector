It is a common knowledge that in our modern society we have some trends according to which more and more women can be emploeed and men who prefer spending time on their job and solving their business problems. In this way parent prefer spending time on their job and they have no time to be spent on their child. I see two key reasons for this problem and also I'll try to identify some sub-problems which these reasons cause. Firstly, the main purpose of changes in growing-up children is the gender equality which had no place in the past. Nowadays, woman is supposed to have the rights as men have. There are many companies which are lead be women and a lot of out-standing doctors are also female. Men have nothing to do than to obey to women if they (women) really want to rule. The emansipation cause the big problem in the family structure. Children are need to be paid attention to and get enough care from their mother, but it is unavailable when "mum" builds her own career and keeps in touch with her child only by phone. The second reason I see is that very small amount of fathers is interested in upbringing of his child. As it was earlier fathers decided that all home tasks should be made by their wifes. We should bare in mind that wifes have their own jobs where they works a lot and came home without any desires about washing the dishes or smth else. In this case fathers do not like to take care about their child and mothers have simply no time for doing it because they are to be busy with other stuff. To make a conclusion, I want to say that males and females both should pay more attention to their own children that not to learn on their own.
