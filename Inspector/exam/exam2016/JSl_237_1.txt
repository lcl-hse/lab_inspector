The bar chart illustrates the amount of children (in millions) in Africa, South Asia and rest of world who do not get primary education. The vertical axis accounts for number of children (in millions) and the horizontal axis specify the region and time. The distribution by gender is showed by the colomn. It is clearly seen that in every region the number of non-educated children decreased from 2000 to 2012. Considerably the numbers closer, it should be said that the most significant dynamic was shown by South Asia with an impressive decline in the number of non-educated girls (from 21,6 mln in 2000 to 4,8 mln in 2012) that was supported by a solid decrease in the amount boys (from 11,1 mln to 5,1). Other regions performed not as strong as South Asia but also showed some progress: Africa had an around 20% decreased of boys without primary education and a 5,5 million decrease of girls with the same characteristics. The number of non-educated girls also dimished (girls from 12,8 to 7,6 boys- from 10,5 to 7,7). Overall the number of children without access to primary education diminished in all regions. All regions showed progress in both genders but in South Asia there was an extreme fall in girls' number. I general both genders in Africa and rest of world were given primary education equally.
