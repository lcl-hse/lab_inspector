According to a popular opinion making prison sentences longer is the best option when fighting crime. There are people who disagree, proposing alternative solutions. In this essay these are discussed and provided with supporting points. 
Making punishment for crimes more heavy means that more potential criminals will think twice about commiting them. Also, more people are going to report minor crimes against them if they know that the punishment is harsh. Another advantage of making prison sentences longer is that those criminals that plan to keep on breaking the law after jail only to go back to jail a month later will spend less time free throughout their life. 
However, prolonging prison terms has its disadvantages. One issue is that most people planning a crime never think that they are going to get caught, so harsher punishments is not going to scare them. Additionally, for someone who goes to jail for the first time it is a chance to rethink his behaviour and go back to normal life. However, the normal prison sentences are the more integrated one becomes with the criminal society during his term, and thus, probability of repeated crime rises. 
Alternative ways of fighting crime typically include improving conditions of bad districts where most crimes originate from, as well as improving jails themselves. The idea is that instead of a severe punishment a sentence should be a correction, and steps must be taken to ensure that conricts do not feed rejected by society. 
Overall, I disagree that the best way to reduce crime is to make prison terms longer, as the disadvantages outweight the advantages.
