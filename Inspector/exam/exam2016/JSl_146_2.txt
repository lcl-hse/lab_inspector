Today it has become popular among big companies to settle their manufactures in the countries at the third world. This process has both a positive and a negative side. In this essay I am going to present both of them. First of all, the obvious advantages of placing business in poorer country is the ability for owners to make their products cheaper. It happens because these countries have economy in a poor conditions, therefor citizens do not require high salaries, because they have no choice. From the poor countries's point of view it is a complicated issue. from the one side it is the new workplaces for citizens, that is very important because of well-known problem of unemployment in such countries. However, there are many disadvantages of this situation. As the main purpose for moving the business to developing countries is to decrease costs, businessmen do not care about conditions at the workplaces. Moreover, they often do not provide their workers with social packages as it is in Western countries. As for me, I confident that the disadvantages of this situation are more significant and can't be oppropriate by benefits for businessmen and consumers who buy these products. Overall, it seems to me that it is possible to delete these disadvantages, if the employers change their attitude towards to workers in poor countries. In this case the moving business to developing countries will solve the problem of high costs as well as the problem of unemployment in the poor countries.
