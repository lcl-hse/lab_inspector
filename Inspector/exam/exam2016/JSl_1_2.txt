Nowadays, most people prefure to spend their holidays in the foreighn country. And also they choose to air travel. But nobody don't thing about is their travel to contribute to air pollution and global warming or not? 
It is not a secret, that the most businessmen to their business on air travel and if air travel will unnecessary and people will choose another travel such as travel with bus (car) or with train, the most businessmens will benkrotes, who have business with air tikets. 
In my opinion if people want that the air not polluted, they choose travel with car or train. The good idea in this situation is a hugh laws to reduce the amount of air travel. 
The governments in each country introduce laws for air travel and for me it is one of sollution to contribute to air pollution. Due to air pollution and global warming there are a lot of ills children was born with different ills. 
For example, in the Chine air very polluted end their buy fresh weather in the others countries. 
Not only air travel polluted (weather) air, but also some fabrics. 
In conduction, I'd like to add that the people must travel in train or spend their holidays in their contry. And they will do if (spend their holidays in their country) if the government introduce high laws of air travel.
