Graph shows us level of investment in renewable energy worldwide and in developed or developing countries from 2006 to 2013 year. Generally it is clear, that worldwide investment grew up strongly until 2011, when amount of money, spend to renewable energy starts rapidly go down. In general, investment in developing countries is very similar to that in developed countries when that amount raises in one kind of country, if raises in anothers two. But there are two exceptions: in 2009 and 2012 years investments grew up in developing countries, suddenly, in developed countries it goes down. The most powerfull charge to investment take part of 2009-2011 period, when investment reach about 170 billion dollars (from 100 billions) in top-economy countries, and 100 billions (from about 60) in developing countries. It is also interesting, that investments in developing countries starts going down with delay of about a year, after developed countries do. Such conclusion can be made, when baking at growing investment in developing countries in 2012 and 2009 years, when in the same period developed countries reduce volume of investment in renewable energy.
