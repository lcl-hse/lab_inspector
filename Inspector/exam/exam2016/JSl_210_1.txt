Several trends are revealed by two graphs showing now many people use Facebook from the desktop of their computer or via the application and difference in usage in social network between men and women in period of 2012-2013. Let me begin by describing the first diagram. It is clearly seen that in 2012 about 150 millions of users preferred desktop for use Facebook and a little bit less number of people (138 millions of users) used the mobile platform. It worth pointed out that in 2013 we can see a markable different trend - the number of personal computer users (who use Facebook through the website) decreased in more than 2 times from 150 to just 58 millions of users. Also it should be noted that number of mobile users are decreased too, but not so much, on 30 millions of users. As for the second graph, it shows us that women like share photos, see funny posts and learning about ways to help others more than men, meanwhile the percentage of men and women who use social networks especially for receiving updates is equal. In conclusion, we can say that the total number of Facebook users dramatically decrease with changing generation and, moreover, there are more interesting things for women in this than for men in average.
