Nowadays, we live in the post-industrial society dominated by technologies, new inventions and developed transport system, and airline becomes one of the most popular types of transport for travelling on the long distances. There is an opinion, that we do not need air travel because of the fact that it pollutes our environment, and that is why the government has to minimize the amount of travels by flights by making laws. However, others believe that the air transport is vital for travelling and doing business. Let us outline both sides on this statement. 
On the other hand, using flights as a way of transportation can be harmful for people's health: different gases, oil pollute the atmosphere and lead to negative consequences such as natural disasters, global warming and may also damage the whole environment. By the way, it may cause different diseases which can affect people's well-being. 
So, government should have efforts to reduce using air travel by introducing lows. 
Nevertheless, not all people agree with this position. Despite the fact, that flights damage people and our planet, they have some advantages. Firstly, they are the fastest way of travelling on the distant corners of the world, saving a lot of time on commuting. Besides, withe the use of flights it is more convinient and efficient to run business or meet with business partners abroad and make your company international. 
In conclusion, it seems clear that the government doesn't have to reduce the number of travel by flight at all, because it is quite useful and convinient type of transport. However, it is necessary to make airline more ecological and less harmful for the health and the environment, I am sure, that it will be possible, if nobody will be indifferent to this problem. As they saying goes, "When there is a will, there is a way".
