There is a popular opinion that governments should prevent our planet from the population produced by airplanes. It is widely thought that by banning air business trips and limitation of touristic air travel the global warming can be stopped. This point of view appears to be mistakable and it will be explained below. Firstly, the contribution of aviation industry to global problems connected with nature is not as significant as it is thought by majority. With more than 500000 factories of "hard" materials all over the world, nature is suffering from chemicals that they use much more than from some pollution by planes. A level of taxing that all these factories produce seems to be an insoluable issue fro the society now. Secondly, regulation of aviation industry could lead to monopolized of this market. The price fro air delivery will increase dramatically and a lot of businessmen will just have to stop operating because of high transportantion costs. As the world economy is balancing on the board of recession, new problems for business could lead to a big crisis. Nevertheless supporters of extra regulation of air industry claim that a lot of people buy their own planes and use them in their own interests without any control commissions linked with nature problems. This argument can be hardly taken into consideration as the statistics of nation aviation commissions show that private jets do not contribute much all-machines net flying time. In conclusion, it should be restated that extra regulation of air industry is not needed. The level of contribution of planes to air pollution s mistakable thought to be very significant and any extra regulation might hurt interests of business very much. There is also not proof that private jets deposit much to the global warming. Because of all above - told arguments governments should not introduce any strict policy to the market of business and private aviation.
