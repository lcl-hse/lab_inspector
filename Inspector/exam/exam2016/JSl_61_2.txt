Factories and plants of world famous brands are located mostly in developing countries. It is common thing today, which is wildly discussed in the society. In my essay different pros and cons of such policy will be considered. First of all, the reasons of why big companies decide to develop their business somewhere abroad are quite simple. The main reason is money. Cheap labour force allows companies to get higher income from the production of their goods. Moreover, labour legistation is not so strickt like in Europe or in the US for example. Nobody is going to check the conditions, amount of salary people get and so on. Secondly, it helps to develop local infrastructure. Addidas company in India build not only factories but also schools for children of workers, hospitals provided the region facilities they haven't had before. Moreover, it is much more expensive to built a factory somewhere in Europe because of shortage of place and also because of higher taxes. On the other hand, there are several disadvantages. Very often people need to work in a very severe conditionals and get small money just because they have not any choice. In addition, companies usually don't check amount of air pollution (or water one). It leads to environmental problems, and, as a result, to the health diseases. The case of China is world famous. The concentration of carbon emissions is too high to breath, people, especially children, suffer because of it very much. All in all, in my opinion, for some countries it is a good opportunit to attract foreign companies and make them invest money in local economy building factories and providing people work places. We shouldn't concentrate all over business in one region, we should broaden and develop all over the world. I believe that to more businesses to poorer developing countries is a normal sensible measure. But we shouldn't forget about ecological issue and workers circumstances.
