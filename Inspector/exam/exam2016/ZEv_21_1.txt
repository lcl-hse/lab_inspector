The bar chart illustrates the difference between the amount of children not able to get primary school education in 2000 and 2012, socted by gender and region. 
There are several trends that we can notice on the chart. In my opinion the main of them is that the number of such children have decreased over 12 years in each region and gender. The most significant fall we can see on the bars of South Asia. Total amount of children without access to primary education have fallen from about 32,7 millions to 9,9. It is possibly connected with the economical grows of this region. 
Another noticable thing is that the amount of girls in each area was bigger in 2000 then the number of boys. However, they were almost equal or at least much clother in 2012. 
To sum up I would like to say that even if the chart shows a positive tendency, the numbers are still huge and this problem should not be marked as solved.
