The picture illustrates the general tendencies in changing the number of potential pupils, who did not have an access to primary school education, from 2000 to 2012. It is evident that Africa is considered to be a leader as well, as it was in 2000. Overall and even divided in gender groups. Then in 2012 the number of children reached a point similar to a point of South Asia in 2000. The noticeable changes has happened to the proportion of subjects in South Asia and the Rest of World. Firstly, if there was a higher rate in South Asia, comparing to the Rest of World in 2000, then in 2012 is became lower simultaneously with the others, but obviously in 2012 the Rest of World had a higher level than South Asia had. That can be said either about girls and boys in these regions. The overall tendency is that in every regions there was a decreasing of the rate (the most dramatic was in South Asia though), and this trend is considered to be a real result of all the supporting policies.
