There is a tendency for huge international corporations to run out their business abroad and for this purpose they commonly choose developing country to help local residents to find a job. There will be given advantages and disadvantages of this development. On the one hand, when international companies start business in poorer countries and emplay local workers. They help these poore people to get enough money for the living. Those who works for the new company will gain enough resources to support themselves and family members. Moreover, local workers need certain skills for being employed and international corporation are opened to teach that skills. On the other hand, it is usually seen that when a company start its business in a poorer country, it does not support this country, as all money goes to a state which owned that company. For example, there are a lot of international factories in Vietnam that use local resources but send all benefits to other countries, while polluting air, water and land in Vietnam. Besides, local workers do not get a lot of money from their jobs for these companies, as companies use them as a cheep power. As a result, local families still cannot afford themselves to live in a comfortable homes, get higher educational and travel. To sum up with the ideas, it is possible to use that advantages and disadvantages are in the same weight but I believe that this development ruins the local economy of poorer contries and does not support it at all.
