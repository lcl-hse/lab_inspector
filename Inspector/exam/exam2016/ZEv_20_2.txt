Nowadays, people argue whether there should be a law that will reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I am disagree with them for some reasons and this essay will explain why. 
Air travels are necessary part of global communication. They are the main reason of rapid globalization of the word. Reducing the amount of air travel will slow down the process of development. For example, if we compare development of world trade during USSR times. Then most flights were restricted with a period of modern Russia we will see that global trade and global travel of people are making both countries economics better. 
It is also obvious that in a closest future there will be methods to reduce waste from planes. It will make flights completely safe for the environment. There are a lot of concepts of planes that are eforking on biofuel. As an example, Lochhead Martin presents a new engine that will decrease the amount of toxic traces. On the nearest future this project will be ready. 
To sum up, there are no serious reasons for reducing flights. Ecological problems will only exist in short-term period and won't affect the global processes on Earth. In long-term period we will get ecologically clean planes that will make flights completely safe for the environment.
