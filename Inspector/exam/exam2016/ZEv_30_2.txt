Travelling by air becomes more and more popular nowadays. It is useful for both business and leisure. However it is a proven fact that this way of travelling causes global warming and air pollution. As a result, special laws to reduce the amount of air travel should be introduced. So, in this essay I am going to prove it. 
First, ecological system is rather fragile, so the humanity should take care of it. In other case all the population will face the risk of extinction. According to this danger, reduction of the amount of air travel is not so crucial. 
Second, there are many alternatives to move from one place to another. Ships and trains easily substitute planes. In addition, these ways of travelling are rather comfortable and less harmful for the health. 
Also, air travelling is not yet the safest way to reach the destination. There are lots of crashes in recent years. Air terrorism is a new reality for passengers. So, many people die. Such cases become real national tragedies. 
To sum up, I strongly believe, that governments should make efforts to cut down the amount of air travel. There is no matter what are the reasons for travelling - doing business, having a holiday or something else. Being under so many risks has no rational purpose. Every person should remember that the life and the health is the main value for him or her or for his or her relatives. So, governments should introduce any relevant laws to make this situation better.
