For the last two centuries our planet has been changed by us. Our inventions help us, but destroy the invirement. Air travel is one of these inventions. If it hirts our planet, is it better to cancel from flight? Should goverment introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel only for business and leisure. 
Lots of people understand that is it not a good idea. First of all, air travel is the fastest line between two points. For turism it will be a hit, because holidays are limited, so people can forget about long travel, because they cannot be in time. To travel by cars, trams, ships are very slow for our time. People who afraid of sea can forget about travel on holidays to other continents. It is bad for people with fobies. Also the land traffic and price on tickets will increase. The land (or sea) travel will look like a hell. Economists can say that island turism will have a big costs and problems with transferring people, because of hard-traffic in ports. I also think that to introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure is a good idea. It would be better if governments introduce laws about clear-oil and well-modificationed air-planes that would hert our planet so hard.
