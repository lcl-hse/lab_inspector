The information provided bat chart illustrate how changes the number of children who have not access to education in primary school from 2000 to 2012 in three regions: Africa, South Asia and Rest of World. 
Overall, we can see that number of children in every region decrease between 2000 and 2012. A closer look at the bar chart reveals that the biggest indicator is number of children in Africa in 2000 (23,7 million). And the smallest indicator is number of children in South Asia in 2012 (4,8 and 5,1 million). And there is big change in South Asia: number of children plammed between 2000 and 2012. 
In conclusion, I want to say that the regions which we show in the bar chart have big changes the number of children have the ability to study in primary school.
