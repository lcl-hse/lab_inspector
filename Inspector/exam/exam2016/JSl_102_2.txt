Nowadays many businessmen try to make their business for developing countries and local workers. These actions have so positive negative features so the essay will represent some analysis of the situation. On the one hand, the activity is a great deal, and there are some reasons for it. To begin with, doing business for developing countries gives an opportunity to make level of life higher. Developed countries have good facilities for citizens but other ones need in help for increasing it, and business can play a very important role in it. Secondly, moving own deal to poorer deserves real respection because the activity brings real use for developing societies. Not every businessman can make such decision so people who did it should take positive estimation of others. On the other hand, the approach to own deal has some disadvantages. Firstly, the business has opportunity not to bring essential benefits. Activities which are done for people and necessary for them often do not give good money. Than, if we look from point of sociology, sometimes the activity can have low status and prestige in society so a person who do business with rich and influential people act better perception than a businessman who interested in help poor people. In conclusion, I would like to say that doing business to poorer countries is great and necessary activity. All the negative sides of it cannot be compared with use which it brings people from developing countries. Such business discovers many opportunities for people and makes an attempt to more equal level of life of different countries that is very important today.
