Airplane is not the most eco-friendly kind of transport, speeding global warming by air pollution. It is discussed whether it is suitable to decrease the number of flights to stop the devastating impact of air travel on our planet. Surely, with development of high-speed ground travel, such as faster trains like ICE, the need for aviation slowly disappears in most developed countries high-speed train networks offer the same routes, but trains are cheaper, more ecological, more comfortable and sometimes even faster: in most cities rail terminals are situated in the center, while the airports are usually located far in suburbs. The second disadvantage of an aeroplane is comfort and security: passengers are suited in far more narrow space, which deprives of personal comfort and makes survival case of emergency more complicated, which is an actual problem, taking in account the increase in number of plane crashes and terrorist attacks. 
However, there are arguments for opposite point of view. The main is a fact that airplane is still the fastest way of travelling to high-distance and remote destinations: no train can move a person from New York to Moscow in ten hours. It is especally important for countries like Russia, where the space exceeds imagination, but development of ground transport is still far from satisfactory. In the same time, building railway networks is highly expensive because of climate, so aviation is the only suitable mean of transport. 
In conclusion I'd like to say I moderately agree with the statement, but taking in account country we're speaking about. In Europe in land flight ban seems acceptable but in Russia with its vast spares it is impossible.
