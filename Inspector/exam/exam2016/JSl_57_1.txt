The graph provides information about the amount of money that was invested in renewable energy in the world between 2006 and 2013. It also illustrates the difference between developed and developing countries concerning this problem. Overall, it can be seen that the investment increased and then fell a little between 2011 and 2013. The bar chart shows that developing countries had been expanding the investment in renewable energy much more steadily than developed countries during the given period of time. The biggest amount of money spent on the renewable resources was about $100 bn in 2012. However, the investment rise in developed countries was not so stable, it fluctuated between 206 and 2009, then there was a dramatical increase of it and investment reaches its peak at more than $ 170 bn in 2011. As can be seen from the line graph, the world total amount of money that was spent to develop renewable energy highly depends on the investment of developed countries.
