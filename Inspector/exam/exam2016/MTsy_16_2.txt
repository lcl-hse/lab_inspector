Now there are a lot of new tecnologis that can prove to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming and air travel is one of them. But Now travelling by plain is one of litle cost and if our goverment introduce lows about air travel many people can't travel. Some people belive that it is necessary to introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. 
But in my opinion travel by plain is the most convenient way becouse firstly, people can go to place they need by less time than by train. Secondly, statistics say that travelling by plane is one of the savest way for travell and firdly, in Russia it is the chipest way for travel becouse Russia is biggest country and travel in long way by train is very expensive. 
But on the other hand of course air travel has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution become critical our goverment must to do some things. For example they should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure or they should do the price for train less. 
To sum up I should say that air travel is one of the convenient and comfortable way for travel and people can't easy efuse of them. But if there is not another way to save our planet people can efuse of their air travel.
