There is a common worldwide spread trend when international businesses are moving their companies to Developing countries and after a job to local workers. In this essay. I am going to analyze advantages and disadvantages of this hotly debated issue. On the one hand, there are many benefits of building businesses in poorer, developing countries. First of all, when international companies hired locals they not only give many workplaces for people but also help those countries to inrich their economy. Another positive aspect of such cases is that usually when companies build their factories they improve roads and lands, which are located not far from the territory of their factories. Speaking about th other side of the coin, developing businesses in poorer countries definitely has some negative aspects. One of the main disadvantages is that with increase of factories the nature of such countries as India and China is getting poorer and wicker. For instance, there are thousands of kilometers of forests are disappear every year by giving space for new factories. In conclusion, personally I believe that there are more good aspects of moving companies' businesses to developing countries such as India and China, but never should we forget about eco resources that could take years to be renewed. In general, it could be said that benefits outweighed negative aspects and harmful effects.
