Nowadays, children spend more and more time without parental attention, doing whatever they want, and this issue is getting crucial for our society. Overall, there are multiple reasons why parents cannot spend as much time with their children, as they did in the past, such as another life orientation, life rhytm and constant need in money. The lack of parental attention causes such problems at difficult social adaptation of child, the lack of motivation in future, development of bad habits. The first reason why parents spend less time with their children is accelerated life rhytm. Nowadays, the market is inundated by high-qualitied specialists and people spend much time working to be able to reach higher qualification, to earn more money for the family. The second reason is that modern people think more of their career chances, than of making the family and nurturing children. The traditional values were replaced by material values such as money, comfort, high level of life. People need more and more money to satisfy its own demands and in the case career becomes the key factor for people. The most important problem caused by the lack of parental attention is difficulties with children social adaptation. I mean, children learn how comunicate with the help of their parents example, and if child cannot communicate freely with his parents, how should he interact with other children? He will not be able to make friends and work in collective, which is very useful skill for future job. Another crucial problem is that child has no motivation to learn. Parents must explain, why it is necessary to get good marks, memorize information, to explain what is bad and what is good. No one will help your children to understand their sense of life, but it is really hard to do when you have no time because of work.
