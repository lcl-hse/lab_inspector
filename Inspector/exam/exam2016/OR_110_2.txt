With the industrialisation and modernisation of the society adults tend to spent less time with their children and family. In this essay I will introduce some major reasons for this trend and related problems. To begin, there are various reasons for parents to spending less time at home. Firstly, in the past most of the work were connected to home, but with idustrialisation and the development of modern technologies a lot of new distant workplaces were open. For example, peasants needed to work on manufacturies in order to provide their family with enough food supplies and shelter. Secondly, today a substantial part of families are nuclear and usually have up to two children. It means that now siblings or grandparent do not help with chidlren's upbringing, so parents have to seek for additional help from nurses, that require more money. Moreover, bringing up the child is becoming more expensive than ever and not every family can afford only one working parent. As the time spend with a child decreases, a lot of problems arises. If parents do not spend enough time with children, when they cannot control him or her. This can lead to smoking, drinking alcohol or even drug addiction outside the home. Another problem is psychological, it has been proved that the amount of time spend with the mother in the childhood is closely related to future mental state and even future income. To sum up, in the developed countries parents tend to spend less time with their children because of work. There are several problems related to this trend, so solutions have to be found to prevent this problems.
