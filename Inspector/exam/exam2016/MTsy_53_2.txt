Nowadays, in modern society, it is normal to travel by plane, but some people belive, that government should stop unnecessary flights to save the planet. There are some arguments for and against using plains for business and leisure.  Firstly, plain is the fastest type of transport. It is the main thing for business, because time is money for companies. Secondly, it is the thing wich can combine two or three transport in, because without it, you should travel by car or train, after that, on the ship or boat and by car, bus or train again. Moreover, all other types of transport exept walking by foot or riding a bysicle are harmful too. All cars, trains,buses, ships need enerjy, for example oil, and this product contribute to air pollution and global warming, than it burns.  However, people lived without plains for many many years. The air was more clear and fresh, it means, that planes are killing our planet. To add to this, the products (aluminium), wich is used to make plains, is make influence on the pollution too, in the process of building the air transport.  In conclusion, I would like to say, that I clearly understand the opinion of such people, who want to save the Earth, but in the 21st centure we cannot imagen our life wihout travelling, it means that we cannot live without plains, because it would make influence on all spectors of life, on work, on privat life. But the main looses will be in the economics of developing and developed countries.
