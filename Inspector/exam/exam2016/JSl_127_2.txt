In modern world big and famouse companies start to move their manufacturies and businesses to the poor countries where people do not have enough places to work and the countries which are still developing. Such movement have benefit but some people think oppositly. The first advantage of movement business to the developing countries is the opportunity for native people to get a jb with good salary. The second benefits is that companies decrease the investment in manufacture what do the prices of goods lower. For example people all over the world use the things that was made in China and it is not the secret that such goods re much cheaper than others. The next good point of the movement is the creating a better quality of life to the people of developing countries. At the same tie there are a number of reasons why the movement of business is not good idea. First of all, the poor quality of products that can be broken easily. The second reason is the bad influence on the environment/ big factories do unpredictable harm to the atmosphere of our planet. Next problem that connected with the business in poor countries is the creating places for the building of factories. They cut the forests, polute the soil, the huge part of the land become useless and damaged. I strongly believe that advantages of the movement business of the developing countries do not outweigh the disadvantages. In general, we bye something cheap but after the year of using if we should bye the same good again. It is more relevant to get a high quality product, it is expensive but at the same time it is hard to break it. The main benefit of such process the places to work for the people of poor countries but the harm that manufacturies do to the environment cannot be fixed in the future but the economic situation in the developing countries become better from year to year.
