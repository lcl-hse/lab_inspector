Nowadays people tend to think that prison sentences is the best method to fight against crime and only small part of them have another vision of solving this problems. To my mind, prison is not efficient and way to punishment of course in the majority of cases this solution have positive impact on social life because it is obviously prevent society from new crimes at least until for example murder robber or dangerous terrorist have arrested. But this way have also big disadvantages. For example prisoners who realesed from jail can have intention to avenge people who judged or arrest him. Also we have another well knows cases, where people was punished accidently due to judges mistakes. I suppose that there are alternative ways of reducing crime. Firstly it can be some actions for helping poorest and illness people. For example, law that allow to going any benefits from government. Secondly education of crimes motives can help police and psychologist prevent crime in many cases. Finally, benefits for good actions can help to choose people right way instead of crime. To sum up, I believe that not only longer prison sentences can reduce crime in world, but enhanced people relationship and increasing life level of all groups of people.
