Nowadays different social media are essential part of our lives. Most people use them almost all the time. But what is the main purpose of social networks? Some people believe that social media should be used for sharing useful information while other people argue that social media exist simply to have fun. In my essay I will discuss both points of view and provide my own opinion. A lot of people say that the initial purpose of social networks was to gain knowledge. They say that a person may use them for work, studying or self-education. For example, a person can be friend somebody from a different country and to know more about culture of that country. It is also easy to conduct a survey through social networks which might be helpful for students studying social science. Besides a person might also read some articles about politics, economic and another subject he's interested in. at the same time, many people argue that social networks to be used for entertainment. A person educates himself in school or university and uses social media just to relax. For example, a person can play games or watch movies he loves. Social media also allow people to communicate with their friends and to make new friends all over the world. In conclusion, different people have different opinion. As for me, social media can be used for both education and entertainment. Sometimes I use social networks to search some useful information for my studying but I also use them to communicate with friends and have fun.
