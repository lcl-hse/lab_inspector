Travelling by plane has a huge influence on the air pollution and global warming. It is possible to the state creating new laws about the number of air travels for business and leisure. I'd like to say about about this statement and how goverment can influence on it. 
On the one hand, air travel is really a very dangerous way to travelling for our planet. Firstly, it has different gases which make our pollution very duty. Secondly, sometimes planes flies with 5-10 people on the bort. As a result, there are a lot of different plane's flies. 
On the other hand, air travel is necessary and very important nowadays. Businessmen should travel so fast so it is possible. Furthermore, there are a lot of other kinds of transport, which destroy pollution on the planet. For example, trains, cars, bus and so on. So, people should create new machines to clean air, as an example. 
In my opinion air travel is the fastest way to travel and it makes our life more easier. Nowadays, governments are deciding more useful and important problems, such as peace in the whole world and economic difficulties. To add to this there are some extreme situations when air travel is the best way to travel. 
So, people should think about technical prgrss and scientific discoveries for cleaning the planet. 
Of course, social life is the mainest part of our life, but I gess that it is impossible to change modern life, where time so expensive. To crown it all, despite other people's view I still believe that life become more and more quicker, and it will be vere difficult to change people's habits and opportunities.
