There are widespread opinion about repercussions of air travelling like contribution of air pollution and global warming. Some people think that the good solution of this problems is to decline the number of unnecessary travelling by air. I have to agree with those who think that the government should protect the unnecessary travel by laws, because planes damage our environment too seriously. First of all government can reduce the amount of travel in aim of work. For instance, businessmans can solve some problems with help of technique and online services. They can just plane their business partner or call them in the Skype, for example. It can be difficulties with identifications of persons who can flying for a business questions and who can not, but it can be solved by changing the process of buying tickets for air travel with entering the stage of writing the aim of travel in colours. What about the traveling for leisure like summer holidays travel, there are cannot be restrictions in the peack-time when a lot of people have their holidays and travel. However, it seems me that in other periods, when the most of citizens is working, governments can raise the taxes on air travel which depends on tickets costs and it can reduce the quantity of air travel with following declining the air pollution of planes. To conclude, government should to protect the unnecessary air travels by laws, because it is one of the causes of global warming and environment solution. For the first time people can negatively comment such restictions but it is the piece of cake for person to limit his or her air travelling. If people wants to save the environment for their children.
