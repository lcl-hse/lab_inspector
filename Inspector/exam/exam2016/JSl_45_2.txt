It is a fact, that are pollution has risen with the start of air travel centure. So this essay will discuss the necessity of decreasing the number of air flights. It is agreed with the author's opinion. That people should reduce the amount of air travel that we can save the environment. First of all, frequent flights influent on are pollution and result to global warming. So the number of air travels should decrease. First opportunity to reduce the next generation, which can transport an enormous amount of people and use new type on soil for there engine. This investment of these types of plane will be very expensive but will help to reduce amount of flights and will be more safety for environment, because they will be able to do one flight indeed five of sive flights by old planes. The second way to decrease a number of unnecessary air travels is to ban small private airlines and private planes, if only the last are not governmental planes for important international visits. If there are fewer amount of private airlines, that government will be able to develop common air travels companies, to watch for the technical condition of the plane and the convenience of the passengers. So this decision will help not only to reduce the amount of flights of private planes but to increase the quality of air travel for passengers and for the technical condition of planes, which belong to government airline and have all necessary technical checking results.
