Nowadays, many international companies move their businesses to poorer, developing countries and employ local workers. Due to our living in a fast-moving, it is obvious that some countries show more efficient results on the world arene than others. So, there are two sides: rich part with international business and a poorer one, which only tries to find her way to the lieder position. I personally believe that there are more benefits for everyone when huge corporation move to developing countries and give opportunities to local workers to be a part of international community. There are a lot of real well-qualified professionals, who are unable to have a chance to work in a world wide company due to their natural habitat, which is undeveloped or poor country. According to this, big organization have an ability to range professional sphere of their companies and to start producing more efficient productions and services. To say more, if is easy to meet people with approximately opposite points of view on the problem. For instance, our society is full of problems and some of them are better shown from the side of poorer areas than from developed ones so employing local workers to the international organization gives a chance to solve if using some differ tools. However, there may be seen some negative effects. Huge companies may lose their lieder positions on the world scene in case of such development. Nevertheless, it depends only on the company and her aims for work or not. To sum up, it should be mentioned, that every development has both negative and positive impact. However, it seems to me that the weight of such influence is much more important. In this case, benefits are definitely overweight the disadvantages.
