The diagram illustrates rises and falls in worldwide investment in renewable energy. Here can be seen the period from 2006 to 2013 and the results of developed and developing countries. In the period from 2006 to 2008 the investment is rising gradually from 100$ to 171$ Bn. Developed countries invested more then 100$ Bn in 2008, when developing countries invested 50$ Bn or more. In 2009 the investment begins to fall, stopped on 168$ Bn and then rises rapidly until 2011, saving it's position on 279$ Bn. At that time developed countries picked 170$ Bn, when developing stayed at 100$ Bn. In the period from 2011 to 2013 the investment in energy decreases, stopped on 214$ Bn. The investment in renewable energy, as it can be seen from the diagram, increases in the period from 2006 to 2008. One year it has similar results and in the period from 2009 to 2011 it has sharp increase. At the end, the investment in energy falls and saves it's results on 214$ Bn. The investment of developing countires increses step by step, when the investment of developed countries has similar high results some years or increases rapidly.
