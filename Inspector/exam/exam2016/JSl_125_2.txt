In the modern world there are many spectors of management of companies and other factory. In the last time we can see the trend of undergoing businesses to poor location of countries which start to develope. The head of company employ those who lives in this area. Let's consider advantages and disadvantages of this event. Firstly, it must be admitted, that the developing countries have a lot of pluses from this process. This one improves the economic of this countries and increases the index of the comfort. People get a new work seats, the infrastructure of this place is developing. Secondly, companies spred their business to other territories and it bring to new consumers and fresh demand. This is the positive action for developing every firm. On the other hand there are some disadvantages of this process. If the firm employ only local workers, which for example have not special education of skills to work it may distruct the factory. This problem may be solve by inventing teachers or coachers to this developing countries. Also, when international and large moves business to poor area, the small companies which were there before have the negative actions and may died. In conclusion, I would like to say that the main role of this process belongs to countries and governments. We see that there are advantages and disadvantages. Government should to regulate the products of making businesses in the developing countries. It must maintain the position of individual businessmen and businesswomen, which live and work in this location, but don't close the window for international companies because this is the way of development not only of poor countries but development of world economy at all.
