Nowadays, it is necessary to everyone to have enough money and resources in order to live well. That means, that if you want to spend some time without work or just do things, that do not bring you money - you will be actually banned from a today's arrange of goods and services. So, that's why a lot of modern families spending their time with own children. But that cannot go without any following problems. In my opinion, there are two major problems caused by that. Firstly, modern childerns are have to find a way to entartain themselves, so a most of them choosing to watch TV or sit in the Internet. But without the parental advisory they will soack a massive amount of negative and bad information which can lead to ruin their psychical health. With that, they will may never become a "normal" person in society and all their lives they will insist in special places or clinics. Secondly, spend a less time with your children means that it will not be grown up as a parent whants him to be. For example, if somebody whants from their children to continue a family business of to work in a particulat kind of job, where two or even more generations of a family members spent their lives then it is necessary to learn your baby from the beginning of his life because otherwise he will learn by himself and will choose a career in which he suits in the best way. Finally, it is up to everyone how to raise their childs by the way.
