When people hear about a cruel crime, everybody wants to sent the mardor in prison and to give him as long prison sentence as it is possible. It is absolutely understandable - people want to make their life safer. Here appears a question - is it reasonable, try to stop harmful behavior with harm? On the one hand, long prison sentences literally prevent other crimes. Robber or killer will spent the rest of life in prison and will not do more harm. Moreover, law brakers afraid of prison and will not commit into crime to avoid it. On the other hand, prison deteriorate and brakes people's mind and lifes. After prison people cannot find jobs, friends and change their lifestyhle on the whole. There is a big possibility that after some time person after prison will do ahother crime. This consequence is unavoidable, because people use to see and to do harm or pain. As for me, I find long prison sentences too cruel and harmful for people. There are so many stories about people who were innocent and due to the mistake were sent to prison and lost everything. Community should create another way of improving. It could be different jobs or social help. In any case, people have to help each other and first of all government should understand, why person did the crime. I understood it after reading Leo Tolstoy's novel "Voskresenie", where the main character tries to understand the rules of life in prison and the reasons of beeing there. Tolstoy gives a clear idea that everybody can change the life of prisoner and prevent a crime, people should save their kindness and morality and help each other.
