The given graph shows changes in the worldwide investment in renewable energy from 2006 to 2013 in both developed and developing countries and as a world total. The first thing that should be mentioned is that the amount of the investment in renewable energy in developed countries was higher than in developing countries during the whole observed period. In some years that difference was really impressive, as, for example, in 2006, when the amount of investment in developed countries (about 75 billion dollars) was about 3 times bigger than in developing countries (about 25 billion dollars). Sometimes, that gap was not so significant, as in 2013, when the amount of the investment in developed countries was about 125 billion dollars and the amount of investment in developing countries was a bit higher than 100 billion dollars. Both figures were rather rising then falling throughout the observed period, but there were also some declines. The first occured in 2009, when the level of investment in developed countries and the world total level of investment fell, but the amout of investment in developing countries continued to grow. The second one lasted from 2011 to 2013, where the world total level fell from its peak, which was 279 billion dollars, to 214 billion dollars. In spite of such a significant fall, the figures are still much higher than in 2006, when the world total level of investment was 100 billion dollars.
