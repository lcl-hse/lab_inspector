At present, there are a lot of air planes and companies that offer servises of air travel to any distanation and it is acessible for everybody. But there is a great drauback of plane is that they pollute our atmosphere and also ot can be result of global warming. that is why some persons want to prevete the air travel or also they want to reduce the amount of this type of travel by introducing special laws for business and leisure. As for me, there are some points to disagree with this statement. 
At first, plane is more ecological transport that other. Not only planes contribute the air by chemical gases, the car's vechile emission is more greater that air pollution by planes. Secondly, at present people, modern scientists thing about creation of special type of ecological fuel for plane, which do not hurm to uor atmoshere. Finally, modern humanity cannot avoid and reduce the number of air travel because of globalisation of modern world. Some companies has filials around the world and it is unreal to manage them from one place, directot need to move to each other and control them and air travel make it possible. Also, sometimes it is unnesesary to replace somebody or something from distant corner to for example hospital. And plane is most quekest transport. 
But on the other hand, there are some drawbacks, such as air pollution. Also, there are a lot of technical damages of air of modern world. It is the fact, that today become more bad events that such as crushing of plane. 
To sum up, it should be said that, plane is useful and nesessory transport for modern life and as for me, modern humanity cannot avoid and reduce amount of air travel, because it is convinient, comfortable and accesseble for anyone at anytime.
