The graphs given describe the amount of Facebook users during a year between March 2012 and March 2013. The first graph compares the usage of mobile and desktop versions and the second graph shows the presumable reasons for using the network. The data are provided in millions of users per year and the percentage of participants naming one of the reasons, respectively. It can be deduced from the graph, that the use of desktop version by men and women differed slightly, showing a small gap between 145 millions (women) and 127 millions (men). In contrast, the popularity of the mobile version among women demonstated a 100 millions downfall compared to that of the desktop version (47), while men used it almost twice as much (87 millions users). In general, the mobile version was approximately only half as popular as the desktop one. Speaking about the reasoning given by the users, more than a half of female audience used Facebook to share photos and videos (54%). As for the men, such reasons as sharing photos/videos and receiving updates were equally relevant (39% both). A slight descrease of interest can be noted in seeing funny posts (43% of women and 35% of men). The least populare Facebook feature was learning about ways to help others, in which only 25% of women showed interest. Overall, it can be stated that the use of a desktop version significatly dominated for both genders, the main reason for that being sharing photo and video materials. About 40% of general interest was in receiving updates and seeing funny posts, and the smallest amount of people used Facebook for learning about ways to help others. Gender differences in most cases were insignificant.
