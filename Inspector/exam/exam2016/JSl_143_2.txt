In todays world a lot of international companies place their businesses in poorer areas and employ local workers. Many people claim this situation to have many negative effects. Others argue that pros outweigh cons. As far as I am concerned, the advantages illuminate the disadvantages. Firstly, it is a well-known fact that producing goods in developing countries is cheap. Thus, the producers could invest saved money in upgrading production or inventing new stuff. Secondly, by doing business in poorer countries international companies help to develop their economies. Furthermore, moving businesses abroad provides local workers with jobs which are often hard to find in a developing country. On the other hand, there are some people who argue that replacing business in other countries has more drowbacks. According to their point of view, moving companies production abroad leads to the higher level of unemployment in a country where this company originates from. However, I cannot agree with them as nowadays people living in developed countries have no wish to do unqualified jobs. Moreover, most of these people have a higher education and are able to find more prestigious job. Hence, there is no demand for unqualified workers in developed countries. Talking everything into account I would like to point out that moving international companies' businesses to poorer countries has more benefits for people living in both developed and developing countries and also for the producers of goods. By placing the business abroad we provide locals with jobs, stimulate their economy and earn more money to develop the production of goods.
