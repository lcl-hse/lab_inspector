We can the number of children without access to primary schools in three parts of the world between 2000 and 2012 with the help of the given chart. 
In Africa the percentage of children, who couldn't go to primary schools was at it's peak in 2000 - 23,7% of girls and 20% of boys couldn't afford the primary education for some reasons. In the next 12 years these numbers slightly fell, for about 5% each for boys and girls. 
South Asia has it's highest level of children, who can't attend primary schools in 2000. Then, the numbers have drammatically fallen for girls - the decrease was more than 15%, and a little fall for boys - exactly 6%. 
In the Rest of World we can see the same thing. In 2000 there was a biggest amount of children, who don't have access to primary education, and then, in 2012, for 12 years these numbers slightly dropped from 12,8% to 7,6% for boys and from 10,5% to 7,7% for girls. 
To sum it up, it's important to say, that the tendency is the same in the whole world - primary education is becoming more and more popular and easier to access.
