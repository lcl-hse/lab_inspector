It is not a big secret that crime is an essential problem of our world. Many people believe that it can be reduced by longer prison sentences. Other people suppose that there are better solutions. Who is right? Most people consider longer prison sentences as a good way of preventing crime. Firstly, many criminals may become afraid of this judgement. Secondly, some of the prisoners commit crime again after going out of a jail, and longer prison sentences will keep them in their cells for much longer time. In addition, they will have a chance to overthink their lives and their attitudes to crime. On the other hand, some people think that is not the best way of solving criminal issue. They suggest alternative methods, such as psychotherapy. Some people believe that even if somebody has become criminal, there is always a way to a normal life, and psychologists are able to help him. The other suggestion is to put criminals to some society- useful works, for instance cleaning streets or building houses. They will make a lot of profit to ordinary people and maybe even like such good and kind deeds. As for me, I suppose that keeping criminals in prisons for a longer time is rather good solution. It does not require any additional payments and can be brought to life immediately. Moreover, it is good way of keeping criminals out of the streets and making our cities safer. To conclude, crime is a serious problem and something should be done with it. Longer prison sentences are very suitable for quick solution and well bring many dividents. However, some other ways should be experimented, because they can be much better in the long run.
