The graph below shows amoun of children (boys and girls), who can get primary education in three poor regions, such as Africa, South Asia and rest of world. 
First of all, if we look at the Africa region, we can see slight decreasing, from approximately 45 million to 33 million of children. Boys and girls have similar fall about 5,5 million duaring 2 years. 
Secondly, South Asia has the most dramatical drop in general amount of children approximately from 33 million to 10 million. Until 2012 year marker fell sharply more than thirdly. 
Also, quantity of Rest of World has decreasing from 13 to 7 million approximately. 
Summarise, every region has dropping and it is very sad, because I consider that every child from every country should have access to primary education. Not only children from modern countries can have education. More than that, primary education is neccessary thing, not talk about secondary school.
