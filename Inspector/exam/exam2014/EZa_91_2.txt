Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas in whichever way they wish. 
In the process of thought many people embark on varieties of fields. It is nowadays well-known subject to create pictures, music but how much freedom is entitled by the government? The issue in my writing for free-express idea in the field of creative arts. 
It is a fact when freeness comes around that everyone selects the way of disuse. Manually, an artist innovates whatever he or she wishes that is calles freedom of expression. Moreover different people have different choices, artists are not exaptional. They can sometimes create art which may affect in society or culture even to the young star. For instance teenagers are naturally influenced by the bad film so such type of film creation can be harmful for the country. A legal action rather than free voice is the best approach for a government. 
In addition, listening music is the most interesting habit for all classes of people. Apart from the negative side, artists can keep traditional cuture by making attractive music on native culture. Is this sense, they are wealth of a nation. Many historical books are taught as an academic lesson in school. If artists have more freedom in terms of writing may be encouraged of their creativing in art fields. 
In conclusion, due to the increase of excessive freely art mayn cause a dangerous impact on every spare of the country. I strongly believe that creative artists are to be valved and will have free voice in crucial writing.
