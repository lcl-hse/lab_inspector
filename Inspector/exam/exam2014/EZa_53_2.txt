It is very important to artists and any other creative people to have freedom and ability to express their own ideas. But from the ancient times to our century there were many restrictions made by government to keep in control these famous people in order to control the society. 
On the one hand, there are many examples of rrestricting some people of saying what they want. Many artists suffered from the government because they tried to bring new ideas to the community, make people think some other way. This always made many problems to the government policy, because it could lead to some revolutions or local conflicts. Using this as the main reason to keep mass media under a control, some politicians try to solve their own problems. So the main problem of government controlling of artists is an ability of some non-honest people to influence on artists and on culture in general. 
On the other hand, leaving a full freedom to artistw means that some artists can invent anything in their mind and they try to show ideas that may have a bad influence to people. For example, some musicians made people to love drugs. So in some situations, it is better for all society to keep those artists from such things. 
To conclude, it is important to not to allow to any artists to express their own ideas. So I fully disagree with the statement, that there should not be government restrictions on what artists do.
