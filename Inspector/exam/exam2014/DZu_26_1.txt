The table illustrates some characteristics of underground railways of London, Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles. 
Generally speaking, a close connection between date of opening and the length of the railway can be noticed in 5 out of 6 cities. The older railway systems are assosiated with longer routes. For example, London underground railway was opened in 1863 and the length of its route is 394 kilometres; while the railway system in Kyoto is 118 years younger and lasts for only 11 kilometres. The only exception from common trend is the underground system in Los Angeles. It is 17 kilometres longer than in Kyoto despite of the fact that it was built 20 years later, in 2001. 
In contrast, the amount of passengers per year seems to be not so strictly connected with opening date and kilometres of route. For example, Tokyo has 1927 million of passengers in the underground railways with 155 kilometres of route. Meanwhile, the railway system in Washington DC is 29 kilometres shorter it has less than 10% of Washington's amount of passengers. For London and Paris with 394 and 199 kilometres of route respectively there is a negative connection between length of railways and passengers per year. Also it can be noticed that only for Kyoto and Los Angeles a link between kilometres of route and the amount of passengers seems to be positive and comparable.
