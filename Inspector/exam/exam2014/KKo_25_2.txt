You know, one part of people think that free public help should be one of main part of student. Others are against of it and say that it's wrong opinion. I slightly agree with first phrase. 
I believe that charity of different levels improves our world so students which help to homeless people or grow up trees in park make our country better. Moreover, every volunter will have great live experience. They can communicate with other people and make new friends. 
Moreover, if students organise some sport activity they increase physical states of themselves and they friends. In my opinion, very small number of people take part in charity, for this reason we must attract students to this area. 
Nevertheless, this kind of compulsory part of high school programmes take a lot of student time's. They can have problem with study and geting of new knowledge. People suppose some of student want to work and earn own money, but they will be waste they time . In addition, some student afraid of responsibility and have problem in conversation with surrounded people. They have trouble in unpaid community service. 
I think we can grow adults from children only in charity organization, because they feel problems of our worlds and they can change these bad area of lives. Of course. It isn't easy to add community service on high school program, but some years later student will understand usefull of it.
