Our world how is developing very fast. Our life in the cities is going faster and faster from year to year because of that people nowdays suffer from stresses and pressure. So, happines is very important for us, people because we can't live in this complicated world without it. 
However, all people are different from each other and what makes one person happy doesn't matter for another. Moreover, it is very difficult to the person to define what really makes himself or herself happy. 
Such things like happen because, it is a lot things in our world, it is very difficult to try all of them and undeastand what is really yours. Or, for example, people are always adicted from consicvencieses and some time you just don't have time to do things which make you happy. Some times people just didn't understand that they are happy. 
Of course it exists some rules, advices how become happy. One of them which is very important and popular - just be optimistic. 
If you are looking at everything with a smile you'll feel yourself better and so people around you. It is a golden rule of happiness. The second one is tag as much things as you can, take everything from the life, travel, listen music, read book, communicate with people. 
To sum up, I want to say, remember only open person can be really happy. Only person who have some goals in his life can be happy, laying at the sofa and reading the internet won't make you happy.
