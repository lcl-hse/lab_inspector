Nowadays, the contemporary art provides as with an enormouse number of artists, which tries to express their ideas using all styles and methods they are closer to. But some people say, that there should be a list of restrictions, which would stay artists 'hands' under the governmential control. 
To begin with, I would like to say, that for me there is only one point 'for' the government restricyions. And this point is that for some 'creative artists' the art could lay in the sphere that could cause some demage to the society, especially in the multicultural countries or countries with the parochial system of values. For example, you shouldn't perform naked and bleeding somewhere in a tiny russian village, where there is still no culture of using and showing your body for the other reasons except for the hard-work. 
As far as I concerned, my other arguments are going to be the voice of freedom that should be given to the artists. 
At first, we should never forget about one of the main cut point of democratic society - the right to be free in expressing your opinion whichever way you wish. Artists can't be excluded, cause putting under 'arrest' their own feelings will not give them a chance to make a real art, which always a piece of creating. Moreover to say, having government restrictions for art means that there is a rule of autocracy, which brings all the culture under government propaganda and denies people's right of getting a full variety of information and makes people blind. It is well accepted that an artist would never 'born' a real art being under pressure, never know what to expect. 
To conclude with, I trully believe that creative artists should be able to act the way they want being free, except those cases which could harm the society or distabelise it.
