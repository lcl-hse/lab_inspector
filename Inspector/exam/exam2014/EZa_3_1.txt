There are two graphs show how people use electricity during the whole day in summer and winter and for what they usually use it. It's very easy to understand why people use so much electricity in winter compare to summer if we look down to the pie chart. More than fifty percent of the electricity is used for heating rooms and heating water, that's more useful in a cold season. Other things such as ovens, kettles, TV and food mixers are used during the whole year. 
By the way, we shouldn't concentrate just on the season differences. It's also very important to say about using electricity during the whole day. This graph shows us the fall at 7 a.m. and the rise from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. in winter and from 4 p.m. to 10 p.m. in summer. It can be explained by our daily timeplan. 
In conclusion I want to say that it's really easy to explain how people use electricity and we can't live without it at all
