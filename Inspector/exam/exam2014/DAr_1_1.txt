The charts below introduce the present data about population of Yemen and Italy and projections for 2050. Half of the Yemen population in 2000 includes 10 to 14 year old people. A slightly smaller part is taken by 15 to 59 years. The smallest part, that is estimated only as 3,6% is hold by 60+ years. Italy has a greater part of 15-59 years: 61,6% and 46,3% in comparison. There is a smaller part of 0-14 year old people and a quater of the whole population is hold by 60+ years. The projections for 2050 realise steady growth in the quantity of 15 to 59 years in Jemen. The part of population that includes 60+ years in Italy will almost double, while the number of 0 to 14 year old people will threaten a constant decline. The same decrease is predicted in Yemen: the percentage fall from 50,1% to 37,0%. The greatest part of population will be hold by 15 to 59 years.
