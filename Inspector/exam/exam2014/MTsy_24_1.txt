The ages of Yemen and Italy populations in 2000 and projections for 2050 are shown in the graphs in percent. 
To begin with, in Yemen the biggest change in the number of people is predicted to children (0-14 years) and to the people of middle age (15-59 years). There can be made a comparison in 2000 children had 50,1% of all population, but in 2050 this percent will decrease to 37. What is more, the number of people who are from 15 to 59 years is going to change from 46,3% in 2000 to 57,3% in 2050. However, the population group of 60+ people is going to change by growing in only 2%. 
Speaking about Italy, it can be said that in 2000 and in 2050 the majority of all population was and will consist of people of middle age (15-59 years). But there is going to be a great change in number of 60+ years people: it will grow almost twice in size: from 24,1% to 42,3%. The number of children is going to stay stable: 14,3% in 2000 and 11,5% in 2050. 
In conclusion I would like to say that in Yemen the big change is going to happen with children and with people of middle age. However, in Italy the number of senior people and also people of middle age will be different to 2050 year.
