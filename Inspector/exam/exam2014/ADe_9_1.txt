The table shows the the number of people in each age group working in certain sectors in UK in 1998 and 2006. 
If we look at the 1998 year statistics and compare the number of people in each sector we can say that the largest number of people works in education sector and there are all about 125345. The age of these people is from 35 to 45 and from 46 to 55. According to this table we can suppose that young people from 18 to 25 do not want working I this sphere, their prioritete is technology and building sector. The fewest number of people from 56 to 65 year works in technology. We can argue that the reason is the old age and few energy for working.
