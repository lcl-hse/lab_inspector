It is always said that increasing the number of sport facilities will have a good impact on public health. There are a lot of points of view on that problem. Some people claim that it is a good idea otherwise there are people who disagree with that statement. On the one hand, the idea of increasing the number of sports facilities requires big financial support from government. Also, there is little probability that citizens will strive to improve their health. It can be because of the lack of the free time, enough money to pay for fitness clubs or gyms, or, perhaps, because of lazyness. Consequently, it is not the best way to influence on public health in a good way. On the other hand, the care of humans' health depends on humans themselves. If person wants stay healthy and be in a good shape, he should do his best to achieve great results. Another way to improve public health is inspire citizens to do sports. It can be inspiration by celebrities, famous politicians, economists and other different persons. Also good way for advertising sport is mass media. A lot of people watch TV, surf the Internet, listen to the radio and read magazines and newspapers, so it will be the best way to make them do sports. In conclusion I would like to say, that both methods to improve public health is effective. It is equally depends on government and person. Only by mixing there two methods people will improve public health and will be happier.
