Nowadays the art is very popular. Many people want to buy some part of art and to have it at home. But now some artists cannot work because there are no places where they can work. 
Being artists is too hard because they have many problem when try to write masterpiece. Sometimes this problem is connected with their wish, sometimes with place of dream, because they cannot find it, or with government restrictions, so they cannot draw all they want. 
Government restrictions are one of the bad reasons why artists cannot create anything. He should work in freedom in place of his dream and wish, and after that he can create masterpiece that will be famous and popular. Also, after creating new picture, by artist it can be forget, because it can have some elements that government restrict. Besides, if there is new restriction, than the picture that is famous can be destroyed. 
T the other side of this problem, government restrictions should be on the way of drawing new picture, because it is our future and to change some thing of opinion about masterpiece, all can changed. People should remember about changing in the past and how it is now. Also some creative artists can create amoral picture, so government should restrict it. 
However with government restrictions create some new pictures, that can be famous and popular is too hard for artists, but it should exist because another way of drawing evolution can destroy modern art and future world.
