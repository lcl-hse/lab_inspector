It consided that happiness is a main aim of our life. The cultural tradition set this goal up and last four centuries (since the Enlighment's era) people all over the planet try to achieve it. 
First of all, it is pretty hard to form the definition of happiness. It may sound silly, but from my point of view, this formula of happiness cannot be widespread by its nature and must ti be confirmed by each person. "Happiness" is an ideal fact of particular human existance and that is why we cannot talk about for example " collective happiness". 
For instance, a several attempts to create an ideal state in history was failed because of the fact that human's happiness is going to become unreal in agiven frames. 
Nevertheless, we can emphasise some factors, which can have an influence on a persons happiness in a comprehensive way. I suppose that all this factors can be involved in a one term - "self-realization". Human need to be realised in social life as much as in person. Just so person can achieve a harmony, unappropriate vibe in his consciousness and balance in his life. Happiness is based on a feeling of the mental balance which is can be only powered by interpersonal relationships.
