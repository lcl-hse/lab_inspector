In this essay such common and urgent theme as ways of improving public health is going to be discussed. I personally believe that increase in number of sport facilities will not significantly change the situation in society. But as it always happens there is another view on this problem. 
Firstly the position of people insisting on wide-scale measure to prevent decrease of public health will be analyzed. It is logical that human health depends not only on exercises that person takes but on the diet, pollution, style of his life and even luck (for example the number of car accidents can influence trends of overall public health). Knowing all this information, improvements in all spheres of life should be done in order to bring harmony into society. On the other hand rationally thinking people believe that sport undoubtfully play a huge role in health increasement. This leads to an easy option - just to build more sports facilities and do not increase budget of healthcare organisations of retirement houses. 
However, I would like to give an example from my own experience. For the last two years in Moscow the number of sports facilities grew significantly and sport at all became more popular among people. But public health did not improve due to small budget of healthcare organisations and big number of immigrants from poor regions. 
To sum it up it should be said that both positions are partially right and combined views are usually presenting better results for solving problems of humanity.
