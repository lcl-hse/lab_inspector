The diagrams describe the amount of people belonging to different age group who study for interest or for career. They also outline if the employers offer additional support to their employees. 
It is clear from the first diagram that people of the age 26 tend to study mainly for career prospects whereas people who are over 49 choose studying because of interest. According to the diagram, the rate of people choosing study for career decreases with the aging. At the same time, the percentage of people studying because interest grows up attaining approximately 70% at its peak. The amount of people from age grows of 40 - 49 is equal both for cases of career estoblishment and simple interest. 
The second graph indicates that employers are more likely to help workers at the age under 26. The group of people of 30 - 39 gets the least support which is about 35%. 
Overall, the fact that people of the age under 26 are getting more help from their companies may be connected to the fact that their main reason of studying is future career development. The people of 30 -39 are supposed to have already settled and organized their career and family life that's why they don't require additional help from their company.
