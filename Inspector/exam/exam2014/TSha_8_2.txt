It is not a secret that some universities have limited vacancies in subjectos of males and females. It can be due to the unequal acception to proffesional spheres. So there are a lot of discussions considering this question. Somebody think that it is normal to abandon girls and boys in their choices. However, from my point of view, everybody should study what he wants. And it doesn't matter who you are: male or female. 
Firstly, if there is an unequality between girls and boys in groups, there are may be better relationships. It can be because of better understanding between them. Secondly, I think, it is really essential to accept more female students in such areas where men are exceeded. This can help to research the problem from the new point. That is why there is no necessity to limit and equal vacant places for students. 
On the other hand, there is an opinion that equal numbers of girls and boys in subject groups can lead to its proportion in all proffesional areas. So there will not be the the sphere where there are only men or only women. But I am not agree with it because, I think, there are some gender themes which are better understood by males or females only. 
To sum up, there are can be many opinions about this problem but for better it's understanding it should be done the social research. Only this can show what is better for society.
