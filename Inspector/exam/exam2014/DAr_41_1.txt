The diagrams in the picture show us the ages of populations of Yemen, Italy in 2000 and possible situation to 2050. In 2000 the percent of people from 15 to 59 years old was 46,3 in Yemen, while in Italy it was 61,6. Also, we can see on the diagrams, that in Yemen 3,6% of the population took the category of persons, who were 60+ years old, however in Italy it was 24,1%. The largest part of the population in Yemen were children from 0 to 14 years, but in Italy this part took 14,3% in 2000. So we can see that in Yemen there were very few people, who were older than 60 years. What's about the projections, the charts show us, that in Yemen there will be less children from to 0 to 14 years (37%), but more people, who are 15-59 years (57,3% comparing to the previous 46,3%) and more aged people (60+ years - 5,7%). In Italy the situation will be changed as well, we can see, that the biggest part of the diagram will take people from 15 to 59 years, as it was in 2000. But the percent of people from 15 to 59 will fall dramatically (from 61,6% to 46,2%). Also, the percent of aged people will rise a lot (from 24,1% to 42,3%). And the amount of children (0-14 years) will become a little bit less (from 14,3% to 11,5%).
