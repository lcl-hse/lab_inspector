The chart provides particular figures for underground systems in different world cities. The underground route in London is by for the longest, while Tokyo subway provides the highest amount of oassengers by transport per year. 
From the 1864 to 1927 years underground system were opened in such a famous world cities, as London, Paris, and Tokyo. The first subway was opened in London in 1863, were 394 kilometres in route and was I pushed by 775 millions of people per year. Compare to this, Paris underground, founded in 1900, was almost half shorter, but allowed significantly more passengers to transport (1191). Tokyo railway, opened in 1927, was only 155 kilometres on route but, compare to previous system, helped to travel to almost 2000 millions passengers. 
In the second part if the 20th century, there were founded another three major railway systems, which although had significantly worse harasteristics. The Washington Dc system, opened in 1976, was 126 km in distance and had only 144 millions of passengers every year. The figures for the rest two undergrounds, Koyoto and Los Angeles, founded in 1981 and 2001, were considerably less than even in Washington DC. Koyoto subway had the shortest route, only 11 km, and the lowest rate of passengers ( 45 million per year). For Los Angeles figures were slightly better: 23 kilometres of route and 50 millions of people, using transport per year. 
Overall, summarizing all the dats given, it is obvious that underground systems, founded between the second half of the 19th century and the first half of 20th centery, had more significant transport characteristics and until today may provide transport provide successful transportation for larger amounts of people, than much younger subways, founded in the last three decades of the 20th century
