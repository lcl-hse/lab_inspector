There are a lot of discussions about the effectiveness of the increased number of possibilities for doing sports. These discussions reach their peak when we say that these facilities are the best way to make health of the society perfect. 
Many people are agree with this point of view and have a lot of reasons for it. Firstly, large number of stadiums, sportsgrounds and swimming pools make sport activities closer to citizens. For instance, you will attend to some sports when they are really geographically close to you. Secondly, much more people would be healthier when the price for doing sports is reduced. In another words, it is easier to keep fit in the case it is very cheap for you. And thirdly, when people do a lot of sports, they do not have much time to ruin their health. For example, they do not drink alcohol or smoke at all. 
Another group of people says that sport activities do not mean as much for our health as other measures. Their first argument is that ecological situation is more important. People who live in the countryside do not often visit gyms but live a long healthy life. Also, the economical situation of population should not be ignored. Scientists have proved that rich people are often happier and healthier than poor ones. 
To sum up, the improvement of facilities for doing sports can help to make public health better but it is not the only one. At the first time we have to think about mental health (or happiness) of sitizens and only after that create new sport objects if they still would be needed.
