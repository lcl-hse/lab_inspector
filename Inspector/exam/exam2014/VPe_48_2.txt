Nowadays almost all students who plan to enter university after ending school face a strange problem: the majority of uni-subjects can be devided into "male" and "female". In first group there are almoust no girls and in the second one, on the conterary, no boys. Some people think it's a normal situation, another ones are sure that there should be equal percents of male and female students in every subject. 
As for me, I fully agree with the first group and would like to provide several arguments, supporting my point of view. 
Firstly, the most important fact for me is that all the students have equal chanses while entering the university. For example, in my country - in Russia, there is a unified exam for everybody called "EGE". While passing this exam students choose subjects they are interested in and them show the results of the test in universities they'd like to study. In such conditions different numbers of female and male students on different subjects can be explained only by different interests of each sex. 
Secondly, I think that people shouldn't make a strong accent on students sex - I mean partly feminists: if there are equal opportunities for everybody to study any subject - people should choose what they like. So, female shouldn't think too much about men and about equal abilities - they should just do what they like. 
To conclude, I'd like to say that there are different oppinions according this problem, but as for me - I don't see any problem at all if students of both sex have equal opportunities. In my point of view corruption while entering universities is much more serious than that.
