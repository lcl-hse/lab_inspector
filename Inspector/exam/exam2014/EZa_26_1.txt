These two diagram show the use of electricity in United Kingdom: the graph reflects a typical daily demand for electricity and the pie chart contains the information about what exactly the electricity is used for. By sumarising the information two main factors can be selected and reported: that winter demand for electricity is higher the more than a half of the whole amount of electricity is used fodr heating. 
The first feature can be clearly identified on the graph: it shows the winter demand as averagely on 20000 points higher than the summer one. Nevertheless, patterns stay quite similar: their peaks are at 21:30 and their falls are between 6 and 9 o'clock in the morning. Another feature is neglected by the pie chart: more than a 50% of electricity is used for heating in any season. Ovens, lightning and electric tools take averagely 1\6 of the whole amount each one. 
To sum up, it may be concluded that the highest pount in the demand for electricity are winter evenings, when heating rooms is crucial. Otherwise, the lowest point in the demand are summer mornings when no heating is needed.
