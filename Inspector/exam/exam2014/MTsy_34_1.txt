In 2050 it is expected the increase of adult population by 7%, the rapid fall of children by approximately 13% and the slight surge of elder people by no more than 2.1% in Yemen. Italy will have the other tendency. There will be almost equal amount of people 15-59 years old and people 60 years old and over. 46.2% of the former and 42.3% of the latter.
