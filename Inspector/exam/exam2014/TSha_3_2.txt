Some critics say that the number of male and female studying every subject should be equal. They believe this agreement will have a good effect on the total results. Let's have a good look at this issue. 
From my point of view there is no need to establish equal number of male and female students in a group. First of all, that is a known fact that men are better in subjects which can be quite difficult for women. For example, engeneering seems to be easy for male, especially when they study cars, while women more often need a couple more hours to understand a mechanism. Secondly, that is usually difficult and is not worth-wasting time to study a subject person is not interested in. Scientists say that the more person is fascinated about a subject (for instance, German language), the less time and energy is necessary to remember new information. Both these examples show that studying a subject which is not interesting and is difficult will not bring better results finally. 
However, some people are sure that the number of men and wonen studying in a group should be equal. Firstly, that helps cooperation between these two genders. In addition, there is a problem that there are too many programmists who are men and doctors who are women. Some people think that discrimination according to the gender may appear in the future (for example, on job interviews). 
In conclusion, there is an opinion that universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. However, I think that this reform will not effect positively on students' results.
