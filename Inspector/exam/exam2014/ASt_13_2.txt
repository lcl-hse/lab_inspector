Nowadays almost all women want to build a career, get the job and be independent. To achieve this goals, a lot of women want to study in the universities. Thus, some people think that there should be the equal numbers of male and female I'm every subject, whole others claim that some professions are not for women. 
On the one hand, from the widespread statistic data the, majority of women have better marks in school than men, they are more occurate and hard-working. In this case women will study in the universities better than men and become more professional. In addition the situation when there are the equal numbers of men and women in the class is more appropriate as in this case students will socialize better, become friends with each other and know each other in difficult situations. 
On the other hand, some faculties as engeneering or physics have low woman's demand as it is very hard to study there. As a result, the universities cannot accept equal numbers of male and female students on these faculties, because women don't want to go there. Moreover, there is an opinion that it is better for girl not to choose hard profession as she should stay home, cook food and etc. 
To sum up, I want to say that women should choose any profession they want, and universities cannot control it. To my mind, of course it is better when in class there are the equal numbers of male and female, because it helps then to know each other better. Moreover, maybe some girls are afraid to go to the faculties as physics, so people can advert profession as good enough for women.
