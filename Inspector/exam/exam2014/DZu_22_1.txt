I was given an interesting table which shows us the general information about underground railway systems in different big cities. I was analyzing it for a few minutes and now I would like to write down my own view about these subways. I should begin with the oldest one. Subway in London was opened in the 1863 and what is remarkable London subway is also the longest one, it consists of 394 kilometeres of route, but despite it length London subway wus taken the 3rd place in the nomination of "Passengers per year". The first place was taken by the subway of Tokyo with its length of 155 kilometeres. Los Angeles subway is the "youngest " one, it began working only in 2001 having only 28 kilometers route and providing rides only for 50 millions passengers per year. Los Angeles would be the shortes subway but we shouldn't forget about Kyoto's subway is the shortest one providing only 11 kilometres of route and serving 45 millions passengers per year.
