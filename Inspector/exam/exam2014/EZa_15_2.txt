Happiness is generally thought to be a crucial part of human's life. But these days, there are a lot of people who are not happy at all. On what depends that feel of happiness and why it is so hard to achieve it? 
This problem became burning nowadays. 
Since ancient times people have been thinking of happiness and the ways of achieving it. No one has said certainly what happiness is yet, so there are various concepts. 
Some argue that happiness is personal well-being, others claim that happiness is money. In different epoches here were special determinations of happiness. Earled people were happy if they were healthy, not hungry and could make their living. 
Nowadays, people are aiming for popularity, fame, power, respect and forget about relations. Their goals are very hard to achieve, but in fact it I a false hope syndrome. Whe you are famous you are barely happy. So I strongly believe that society and mass media disorientate people who are searching happiness. 
I know people who believe that happiness is harmony between a human being and nature. But if we look at the newspapers, we will see deforestation, destruction of natural habitat. So it is impossible to achieve this harmony due to modern circumstances. 
Some people believe that happiness is beaty and art. But art has also become spoiled by business, so it is impossible to destinguish beauty from fake. Such problems lead to disappointment and unhappiness. 
To sum up, I would like to say that it is society and mass media who make it so difficult to define happiness. Everybody could be happy in his own way, but modern life can easily make it roller with up-to-date standarts of well-being, beauty and harmony.
