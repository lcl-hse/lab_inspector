Speaking about Sweden, it can be seen that the proportion of elderly population increased from 7% in 1940 to more than 25% in 2040, although had minor crisises in 1990 and 2025. The number of people aged 65 and over in USA rouse gradually from 9% to 23% during the period under discussion, remaining almost stable in periods from 1940 to 1960 and from 1980 to 2020.
