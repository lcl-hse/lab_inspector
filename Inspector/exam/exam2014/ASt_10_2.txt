The problem of artists expression is really actual nowadays. There is the situation formed in which different groups of people debates to each other whether we should let artists to do whatever they want or restrict some of their intentions. 
As every problematic question which raises such a huge discussions has at least two positions of view and lots of argumentation behind them. Such a conversation couldn't be possible without a special attitude to men of art we used to give them for the beaty that brought by them into our world. Artists always have been people which gave us some inspiration with their work giving us something to admire but times has changed and we can see more and more cases of thing that breaks any moral values from people we used to call artists. 
It cannot be denied that art has always been that engine which moved the humanity forward and it should provide further growth of us. 
But art became a method of making yourself famous and when artists are run out of creative ideas they doing anything get some piece of fame. It even goes to vandalizm and hurt of other people's feelings. 
Bringing this theme to a conclusion I want to say that should be restricted by the means of laws that we already have. That won't give the artists an opportunity to make their fame in a dirty way.
