It is often alleged that happiness is something that is desired by everyone, however, not everyone achieves the feeling of happiness. It is hard to say what the word "happiness" exactly means in general because every person has his own circumstances and factors that make him to feel happiness. 
I am a passionable believer into the fact that every person is a "unique hero" in the world and, consequently, it is absolutely normal that everyone has his own aspirations and beliefs. It means that a thing that makes one happy will not be suitable for another one. Therefore, it is difficult to define happiness. 
Conversely, some people will disagree with my point of view. They will claim that there are some common factors that will help people to achieve happiness. For instance, love, money, successful career, family and strong health. Moreover, these factors can be disposed gradually into a human's value system. By way of illustration, some people believe that "Love is the best thing we do" and having a loving person nearby can make millions of people to feel endless happiness. Regardless of the previously mentioned fact, a lot of people put money and career foreground. 
On the contrary, there is a point of view that happiness is not something we practice: but something that comes to us when we allow it. Taking for instance, there are some people who have everything family, love, money, but they feel nervous and anxious about all those and try not to lose these qualities. 
To crown it all, I suppose that the best thing to achieve happiness is to find the most important factors for yourself. For me they are love, health and friendship. So, we should try to become succesful in that way, having a positive attitude towards life.
