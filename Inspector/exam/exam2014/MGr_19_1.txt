This graph demonstrates usual electricity consumption in England comparing winter's and summer data through the each three hours during the day. The pie chart below represents the ratio of consumption of electricity due to its purpose. 
As can be seen from the graph winter's consumption are fluctuated from 30,000 to approximately 45,000 units where the highest unit is from 22 to 23 p.m. and the lowest data is 30,000 between 6 and 9 a.m.
At the same time, indexs of summer's demand are changed from 12,000 to 20,000 units during the day. Its lowest indexs are happened at the same time as winter's, but there are two highest indexs between 12 and 15 p. m and from 21 and 24 p.m.
Likewise, the pie chart may be differenciated into 4 parts: heating rooms and water has more than half of 100% (52,5%); the next is assumption of electricity for ovens, kettles and washing machines (17,5%) and, finally, lighting, radio and TV and kitchen electric tools have the same proportion at 15%. 
Overall, there are concrete information about the amount of demanding electricity in units in summer and winter and main aims of its consumption.
