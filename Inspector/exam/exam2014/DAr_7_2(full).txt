Nowadays public health is a very important issue for most countries. The question is how to provide it and many people suppose the increasing the number of sport facilities to be the best solution. On the one hand, sport facilities will be helpful for people of all generations. It is possible to find special type of sport for every age and health group. It can be extra classes in schools or universities, free sport centres or special equipment in parks: sport facilities can be provided by many ways and for everybody. Moreover, sport is not only the way to protect the health but also the type of communication. Providing more places for sport facilities government finds not only the solution for improving public health, but also create new options for spending spare time. For example, there is such practice in China where old people communicate with each other doing sport exercises in parks. On the other hand, it is impossible to make everyone doing sport. Of course, increasing the number of sports facilities will provide more interest to sport among people, but this process cannot be controlled. Other measures, such as free vactination can be more efficient, but require more government spendings. Moreover, sport exercises can be harmful for people, who do not know the techniques and his or her own restrictions. In this situation sport gives negative effect. To sum up, I hold the view that increasing the number of sport facilities can give lots of benefits to society and increase the level of health in the country. There are cheap ways of providing it that can make the whole humanity healthier.
