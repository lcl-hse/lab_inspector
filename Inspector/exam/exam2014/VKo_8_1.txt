The bar chart illustrates post-school qualifications in Australia and the proportion of men and women held them in 1999. 
To begin with, we can see that the precentage of men taking the skilled vocational diploma is bigger than the women's one. However, the number of women who have an undergraduate diploma is bigger. 
We can also see that the precentages of men and women with Bachelor's degree similar. 
The number of men with Postgraduate diploma is twice bigger than the number of women. We can find that the difference between precentages of men and women with Master's degree is 20%. 
To sum it up, I want to note that according to this chart the precentage of men with skilled vocational diploma, postgraduate diploma and Master's degree is bigger than women precentage.
