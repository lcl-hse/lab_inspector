The given graph illustrates the needs in electricity during summer and winter days in typical English home. The pie chart gives information about what the electricity I used for. 
Two lines in the graph are flactuating. Demand in winter has a fall at 30000 units of electricity in the morning and reachs a pick at 10 p.m. In that time it is over 40000. Then it sharply falls down. What is for summer demand it changes between 13000 and 20000 and has two noticable rises at 2 and 11 p.m.
If we compare the graph and the pie chart, we will catch that amounts of electricity used on winter depends on what kind of purposes it is used for. Heating rooms and water requires 52.5 percent of all the electricity. Other purposes are linked with home cleaning, for example the work of washing machines or vacuum cleaners, or just having fun (watching TV). 
So we can see that the demand of electricity strongly depends on season and tipe of tools and machines inhabitants of England use.
