There is an opinion that growth the number of sports facilities can help to improve public health. at the same time, others believe that other measures are required. From my point of view, by increasing the number of sports clubs and other facilities can help to people improve their health. 
First of all, when people have a lot of opportunities to do sport training each of them may find a type of activity that he likes the most. People are more motivated when they enjoy doing sports than in the situation when they do not like it. Secondly, if a person find kind of sport interesting for himself, he will meet a lot of people with the same interests. The satisfaction of team work is huge, teammates may become friends. Moreover, there is a strong motivator which can help to improve public health, it is public opinion. Influence of public opinion is significant, that is why when your friends start to go to the gym, you want to do that too. 
However, the growth of the number of sports facilities may not be as effective as we think. There are a lot of other measures to improve public health. Firstly, advertising today has a power to control people's decisions. In that case, social advertisments with examples of harmful for health choices, such as junk food, smoking and couch potato type of lifestyle may influence on people. Seminars and TV-programs about advantages of the healthy lifestyle may help to improve public health, too. 
To conclude, improvment of the public health is very important issue to discuss and increasing the number of sports facilities can be helpful measure to solve this problem.
