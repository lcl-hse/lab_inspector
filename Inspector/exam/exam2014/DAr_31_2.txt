It is fact that everyday people spend only a short period of time to do exersizes and improve their health due to fast pace of life and a lot of other reasons, including the lack of sport facilities. However is it right? Does public health depends on the number of sports facilities? 
Some people say that government should provide more different sports facilities, it should build new stadiums, swimming pools and so on. Issue of public health, of course, refers to the teenagers. The most number of people do sports mainly when they are under 20 years old, so different sports facilities will help teenagers as there is no need to motivate them, they are young and they want to be strong and healthy, so they do sports. However, will it help older people? Also will it make all teenagers do sports, because, as was said, not the whole number of young people trys to improve their health? On the other hand, some people think that government should do something more to improve public health, they doubt that increasing the number of sports facilities will has sufficient effect, because people also should be motivated to do sports, nobody will attend gyms, swimming pools as they wouldn't feel the needs and reasons to do it. In point of view, government should provide sufficient number of sports facilities. More over, it should create motivation by conducting different social events and making advertisement. Also it will be important, to rise prices on alcoholic drinks as it is a big snag in the process of improving public health.
