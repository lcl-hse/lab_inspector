In our modern world more and more people are considered about healthy lifestyle. People try to follow healthy diets, jogging every day and etc. Some people believe that the most useful way of public health improvement is a growth of sports facilities, while others suppose that this only thing will not be efficient. In my essay I will try to view all the points and support it by examples. To begin with, I think that sport is always suitable idea in issues connected with health improvement, as it makes people physically strong and healthy. For example, jogging or going to the gym are quite affordable and help to avoid coach potato lifestyle. On the other hand, I am strongly believe that any sport without healthy diets will not give necessary improvements. As a consequence, people should remember about avoiding saturated fats and should consider about nutritions. For instance, people should prefer eating fruits and vegetables to eating junk food. What is more, I guess that there is an essential point such as good relaxation. In our fast moving world people face a lot of stress that also has a huge impact on people's health. To sum up, I suppose that government should provide all necessary sports facilities as well as educate people from the very childhood that healthy diets a also really important. I believe that there will be a possibility to improve public health, if all measures are taken into account.
