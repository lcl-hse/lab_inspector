The problem of public health is actual and controvercial nowadays. Some people believe that sport centers and equipments in our gardens are enough to improve the situation. The opposites suppose it doesn't depend on numbers of facilities and suggest other ways of problem solution. 
First of all, people who are against sport as way of improving health think that the government ought to protect citizens from air pollution and other harmful impacts of big cities. Furthermore, they claim the main reason of a bad health is a food, so opposites want to change the quality of products and by this way make health better. 
On the other hand, sport departments all over the world are convinced that only an active life style can influence on public feelings. Moreover, they have an opinion that new sport equipment and sport centers will help to grow up strong and smart generation. I have the same point of view and want to add that sport lifestyle should be mixed with the absent of harmful habits and with the right way of eating. 
All thing considered public health depends on personal one. Thus, people should they attitude to their health and take care of it and do sports or even have active way of life. Hovever, people who think differently still exist, so according to my favorite saying "many men, many minds". Anyway, I cannot agree with them who support the idea that sport is not the most important factor of nation health, because during the whole human history every politic leater understands that there is no sense to run "weak" country.
