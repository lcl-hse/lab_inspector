The current graph shows the variety of post-school qualifications in Australia for both men, and women in 1999. 
First and foremost, most men have a skilled vocational diploma, almost 90%, unlike women, with 10% of the same diploma. However, more women get undergraduate diploma - approximetly 70%, while among men there are about 36%. As for bachelor's degree, the proportion of men and women, who own a diploma is almost the same: standing at 55% - for females and 47% for males.

And the last degree is Master's, containing 60% of men and 40% of women.
