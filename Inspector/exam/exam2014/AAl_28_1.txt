The proportion of the population aged 65 between 1940 and 2040 is presented on the graph below. It can be seem from the graph that the peasantage of Sweden and USA population tends to be far more similar, in comparison with Japan population it should be mentioned that until 1980s. These 2 groups were quite the same. There was a gradual increase from 5% to approximately 15%, while in the USA, there was the stable decrease (less than 5%), followed by a sadden "recovery". (From 2000 the situation changed dramatically. What is more, from that year the difference between USA and Sweden age groups became far more obvious as the number of elderly people in Sweden began to rise steadily. However, in compliane with the graph the persentage difference by 2040 was not evident less than 5%. 
To sum everything up, it should be empasized that in spite of different results, japan population (after a perpertual grouth) increased dramatically more in contrast to other countries. Probably that can be explained by the great member of elderly people in Japan of that catagory.
