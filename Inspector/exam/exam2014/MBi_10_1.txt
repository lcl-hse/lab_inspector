The presented grahic depicts the percentage of people aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden and USA throughout the period from 1940 to 2040. 
Above all, it can be said that all of the three mentioned countries show increase in respect to the whole period. Yet, several differences in their development can be marked. The proportion of population aged 65 and over in Sweden and USA rises relatively stably increasing from 7% to 26% and from 9% to 23% respectively. 
The percentage of people of the age in Japan changes in other way. It can be seen that between 1940 and approximately 1987 the proportion demonstrates fall. However, by the year 2040 the percentage of population of the mentioned aged reaches the highest level in comparison to the other two countries. 
Overall, it might be deduced from the illustration that by the end of the period from 1940 to 2040 the proportion of population aged 65 and over increases dramatically in all of the three countries.
