Many school-leavers think about what they want to do after graduation and wether they want to continue their study or not. The bar chart provides information about how many pupils desided to get post-school qualification in Australia in 1999 according to sex. 
The highest proportion of men got skilled vocational diploma. It is approximately 90 percent, although for women it was only around ten percent. By contrast, the smallest percentage for males was for those who desided to hold undergraduate diploma, but for females it was the greatest number (near the 70%). The same percentage of men got postgraduate diploma, but for women it was only 30 percent. However, more females held Bachelor's degree than males (around 55 percent for first ones and 15 percent for second). Contraditionally, on the other hand Master's degree was held by the major quantity of men (60 percent) when women held only 40%. 
It is clar from the chart that generally in the most cases man decided to get higher qualifications more often than women in Australia in 1991. But, by the contrast, females have higher proportion of undegraduates diplomas and Bachelor's degree.
