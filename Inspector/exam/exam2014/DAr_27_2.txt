Nowadays, with developing of the modern world people's lifestyle becomes faster and they tend to spend less time paying attention to their health. That's why some people assume providing more sports facilities would be helpful for solving this problem. While others claim that it would not have that impact and suggest to take other measures in consideration as well. I think this problem rather complicated, so let's look into it more carefully. On the one hand, sport is very important for being fit and healthy. First of all, it helps us to be in a good shape and reduce extra fat in our organism that can be harmful and cause some desieses. Secondly, doing sports can prevent people from having bad habbits such as smoking and drinking alcohol. Finally, sport activities make people's organism stronger in fighting different viruses that can be dangerous for their health and lives. On the other hand, sports facilities cannot solve all the problems. At first, we need to develop and improve such spheres as farmocology and the system of medicine care, that are also crucialy important for mantaining people's health. Moreover, we should protect the environment by solving a great variety of ecological problems. Also we would take care about children and protect them from bad influence of bad habbits. In my opinion, it is obvious that sport plays a significant role in improving people's health. However, we should not forget about other aspects and options that are able to support our health. To conclude, I would like to say that health is one of the most important thing in our life. That's why we should use any means we have to protect it, improve it and support it.
