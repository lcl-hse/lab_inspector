During all the times there was a problem in the world of art that had to lots of misunderstandingsnand conflicts. The problem is connected to the freedom of artists who express their feelings and thoughts unusual for a casual person. Some people believe that it is unfair not to allow creative people do what they want to, others sure that should be some borders for any expression. 
As for me, I can partly agree with such statement aned I have several reasons for that position. First of all, in my point of view the art is a thing that should give a birth to some thoughts and ideas in our heads. So there is no any ensurance that the creations of some crazy artists or poets will not lead somebody to community a suicide for example or killling somebody or simply becoming a mad. Moreover, the art should not be used in order to make a revolution or a civil war. The only aim of all things that ares shown to people is to share the botiness and positive ideas. 
However, when the artist is not allowed to create something he is eagle of, something that seems wonderful to him, he tries to find some other ways to demonstate his drawings and other creations. One of the most brightning examples for me is a street painter who had never been caught. His name is Banksy and streets are his own museum. Somebody calls it vandalism to draw such like pictures o the walls, but he draws everything he wants to and he do not need any permission. 
In conclusion I want to say that eventhough not every creation should be shown to the people., government and police should be less aimed to find something bad in those things that they do not understand rightly and clearly.
