It is clear that in a world many creative people with their own opinions and ideas in different countries government restrict their creative. 
I believe that government do not should restrict creative people like artists, film directors and musicians in their creative. In a result of what they do we get that what help us to improve yourself. We go to the art gallerys and music conserts and enjoy it. We leave in freedom country and we can get everithing for make our live better. If government will restrict our life it will be look like Germany in 1941. 
Bu if creative people get very big freedom they are begin make dirty art and do not respect history. For example different modern films about second warld war. So I think that government do not should restrict creative people hard but should watching and easy control them/
Overall, in the world meny talanted people who want to make something wonderful for society and goverment should help them realise yourself.
