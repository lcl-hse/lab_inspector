Some people say that goverment should no restrict artists in the way now they express their own ideas and give them absolute freedom in it. I personally think, that there are both advantages and disadvantages of this. 
Imagine that there are absolute freedom for artists. What you would see on the streets? "Perfomance" - it may be explanation for every action of people. This man is destroying building - it is perfomance! Group of people takes trash bins on their heads and hug you - it is perfomance! True art can be shoking or even dangerous. So I think that there should be a list of restricts. 
But are there some advantages? I demand yes. There are a lot of types of arts that would make our life brighter and more beautiful if it would be allowed, for example, graffity. Good graffity can decorate old garages, half-destroyed buildings. If you travel by a train or use train to come home from your work you see a lot of graffity during your road and most of them are not ugly or disappointing. So why people who made this must be stopped? 
For conclusion, I can say that giving absolute freedom for artist is risky and there should be a list of restricts, just to provide other people's safety and confidence. I think that goverment should give more freedom for artist, but not absolute. Artist's perfomances must be controlled. But in general more art in our life can make life better.
