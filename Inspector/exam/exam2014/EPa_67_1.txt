The graphs compare information about ages of the populations of two countries from 2000 to projections for 2050. 
It can be seen that amount of children in Yemen in 2050 will be lower than in 2000. It is clear that amount of middle age people will largly increase in 50 years from 46,3 per cent to 57,3 per cent. And population of older people will decrease in this period of time. Graphs below demonstrate the same statistics in Italy. We can see that the biggest part of population is midle age people. But it is clearly seen that in projection there is less amount of people 15-59 years old than in 2000. There is huge increase of older people. It changes from 24,1 per cent to 42,3 per cent. There are some huge changes an all graphs at the list. 
To sum up, we can say that there is correllation between age of people in 2000 and statistic information in projection for 2050.
