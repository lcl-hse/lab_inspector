Everyone wants to be happy. We can say that happiness is the goal of our lives. However, it is very difficult to define what happiness is. 
The point is, happiness is not a very stable estate. No one can be happy constantly during a long period. Another thing is that we can rarely say we were really happy. We cannot say what happiness is because it is not even an emotion. It is more state of mind or soul. So, when we try to catch and identify it, we can loose it. 
One more thing which makes the idetifying of happiness more complicated is that everyone have their own happiness. Some people feel happy when they succeed in something. Other, when they do business that they like. While others, when they enjoy their time with family or friends. Furthermore, everyone can be bored with the thing that made him happy before and they will have to seek for another one. There are plenty things that can make a person happy. For example, children or partner, sports, science, buisiness, video games, TV and this list can be endless what makes happiness a hard thing to find. 
All in all, happiness is a very strange and complicated feeling which is very hard to catch, explain or define. Some philosophers say that happiness is freedom from suffering but, in my humble opinion, it means following your way, feeling confident, safe and comfortable and not wasting your life.
