The line graph which is given demonstrates the percentage of old people during 100 years up to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and the USA. Overall, there is a gradual rise of this index in Sweden and the USA, while the proportion of people aged 65 and over in Japan fluctuates significantly through this period. 
At the beginning of the period which is investigated the proportions of old populations are almost similar. Particularly, they vary from 5 to 9 per cent. As for the next 40 years, there is a steady growth of these percentages in Sweden and the USA. At the same time, the proportion of old people in Japan declined and reached the lowest level of about 3 per cent. However, the extreme rise of the index is forecasted in Japan in 2020's, so that the proportion of people aged 65 and over will overtake the percentages of other two countries. 
To conclude, Japan shows the lowest rates of old people proportion throughout the 20th century and demonstrates the highest ones already in 2030.
