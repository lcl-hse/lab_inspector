The chart shows the total number of minutes of local, national and international and mobiles calls over the period of seven years from 1995 to 2002. It can be seen that the number of minutes of local calls remained greater from the number of other calls over all the period. 
The number of minutes of local calls started with a value of 70 billions in 1995. Then it slightly grew to 90 minutes in 1998 and remained stable during the next year. Finally it dropped to a started value of 70 billions in 2002. 
The number of minutes of national and international was equal just under a 40 billions in 1995. Then it gradually increased to 60 billions in 2002. The number of minutes of mobile calls started of the smallest level of approximately 3 billions, then it stadily went up to about a 10 billions in 1999. After it sharply rose to 15 billions in 2002 what means it became nearly to the number of minutes of national and international calls. 
To summarise, the number of minutes of local calls fluctuated during this period and went to a started value. Both of the number of minutes of national (international) and mobile calls increased but mobile's more sharply.
