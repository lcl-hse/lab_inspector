The problem of public health is getting more and more important nowadays. The lifestyle of many citizens require a lot of indoor activity which cause a bad influence on their health. However, there's two major opinions of how to solve this problem. The first one provides an idea of supporting sports by increasing the amount of sports facilities. The second suggest a bunch of methods not related to sport. 
Of course, the impact that sports have on public health and maximal age is very noticable. Sportsmen have better control of their bodies and more knowlege of their health as well as skills of supporting it. Also, sport activities require a specialised diet or some control over calories and food at last. There's a high probability that social advertising of the sports and establishing sports facilities will also affect "bad habbits" such as smoking, alcohol consuming and even doing drugs. 
But is the sport enough to solve all the public health problems? I believe it is not. Besides of people lifestyle we have many other issues that affect people's health. The most obvious example is air and water polluted by the chemical industries, oil companies and simply everyday use of cars burning gasoline and dumping the waste in the air. 
I also do believe that increasing sports facilities will help the public health but it's not the only thing begging to be improved. Instead of concentrating on just one problem the humanity should spend the resourses wisely, solving the problems of pollution, sanitary, medicine cost and many others.
