The diagrams show the ages of population in 2000 and in 2050 in such countries as Italy and Yemen. The ages for 2050 are just expectations. 
First of all, I would like to compare the ages of people in Italy and Yemen in 2000. The main feature of Yemen here is large part of young people who aren't older than 14 years, and in Italy majority of people are at the age of 15-59. The percent of old people who are older than 60 years is 24.1 in Italy whereas there are only 3.6% in Yemen. 
As for 2050, there are 57.3% of people in Yemen who are not younger than 15 and not older than 59 years. At the same time in Italy the percentage of such people reduced to 46.2 from 61.6%. The number of old people will grow in Yemen only to 5.7% and in Italy to 42.3%. Speaking about amount of children in these countries, in Yemen they are expected to be about 37%, whereas in Italy the percentage of children is only 11.5% in 2050. 
So, the main tendency in population for Yemen is growth of children and in Italy it is the increasing of old people.
