Today one popular believe takes place in our society. There are many people who assume that the proportion of male and female entered a university should be equal. However, in my point of view this may be regarded as discrimination. There are actually a few reasons for existance of such an opinion, that the offered policy is not appropriate. 
There is no doubt that if we admit the requirement of equal number of students of both genders we will also agree with the fact that intellectual or mental abilities of male and female differentiate. Of course, centuries ago men and women didn't have similar rights and opportunities. Consequently, there was a huge gap between study opportunities in both groups back then. That means, women needed to take their time and work hard to achieve the level of education that men had. However, it was believed that women were less able to work and study than men, so the idea of universities accepting the same number of male and female was actual in the past time, when discrimination took place. 
On the contrary, modern females are allowed to demonstrate their skills and intellectual development. Moreover, some women are really more productive in various spheres of life. In addition both male and female students study at schools and colleges or universities under the same conditions. In other words, acceptance of equal number of male and female students would be extremely unfair for instance, if it happens that more men did better at the exems than women, why would the university accept those who did worse and probably is not good at some subjects? Besides, the working productivity will suffer as well. 
To conclude, I would like to underline the fact that the offered idea of equal number of male and female students accepted to a university is not only ineffective, but also poses a problem of discrimination.
