In the modern world one of the main part of human life is to increase the level of public health. There are a lot of different methods to make this dream come true. One people say that in order to solve such problem sports facilities should be improved. Others suggest that it is not enough. 
On the one hand, if government will biuld new sport field, new training clubs it, of course, will help. First of all, because young people will have a place where they can go to spend their own free time. They won't go to bars or clubs and drink alcochol, smoke or take drugs here. Secondly, how people want to develop health way of living without providing sports facilities and equipments? It is impossible. 
On the other hand, other people believe that doing only this action will have a little results at all. I totally agree with them. Government can't achive the aim of health generation without using a mass media. Nowadays, TV, newspapers and internet take significant part in person's life. Society will have a chance to make health way of living attractive by using mass media. Moreover, such way of living should be taken into account in schools and universities. It is very difficalt and hard work to rebiuld the mind of adults, so it should be done with young population, when children just learn what they should do, what is good or bad. 
To sum up the information, I would like to say that new sports facilities are very important, if we want to biuld a health society, but we shouldn't stop on this action. Parents have to show to yound people how they should live on their own example. Only in this way government and all society will have perfect results.
