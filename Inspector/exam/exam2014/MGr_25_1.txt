To begin with, the first diagram illustrates two main reasons for continuing education according to the age of every person depending on the opportunities and interest. Speaking about the second bar chart, it represents the dependance between the student age and the level of the employer support. 
Needlees to say, people are divided into 6 age groups. That's why, the diagram has vertival axes (percentage) and horizont axes (age group). The tendecy shows that the youth is likely to get education because of the career opportunities rather than only interest. Houever, the level of people who are fond of education for interest starts a spectacular ascension from 10% (under 26 years) to 70% (over 49 years). As for the last diagram, there is a low point of people at the age of 30-39 years old and this group has small donations and support for developing the employees' individualtity. 
In conclusion it can be said, that the youth is tend to get extra education because of the career opportunities and abluts (over 49 years) are known to learn anything only for pleasure and their own interest. As for employer, they are more likely to provide the youth with support rather than people of middle ages.
