There is a widely spread opinion that each subject at university has to be attended by equal number of men and women. I strongly disagree with this statement, as other factors should be considered during application. 
To start with, the level of education is the most important factor of future students. That is why, school marks and examinations results have to be taken into account. Consequently, if there are more men with high exams marks than women, there is no reason for accepting the equal quantity of male and female students. 
Moreover, some occupations are so specific that it would be hard to teach men and women to work at these jobs. For instance, girls are more likely to become nurses than boys, but it is hard to work with steel or oil for them. 
However, there is another point of view. Some people are sure that we have to provide the equal rights for both sexes in the process of university attendance. Their main argument cannot be taken into consideration, because giving the same rights to people has to be linked with providing the best opportunities for people who are more talanted and eager to achieve the success in their lives. 
In conclusion I can say that I cannot agree with the opinion that universities have to accept equal quantities of male and female applicants. I strongly believe that other factors are more crusial than person's sex, such as his or her knowledge and professional qualities.
