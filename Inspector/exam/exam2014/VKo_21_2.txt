Creativity is the sphere, which might always be free from government and law restrictions in reason to be able to express artists' own view on art. To what degree it is true? 
From my point of view, the art is a personal and intimate phenomene. That is why creative artists should be free from limits and boundaries. The main argument in favor is that It represents art trends and tendendies of modern generation. This cause leads us to another reason. Freedom in art expression helps present art to create the history. There is no doubt, that government restrictions erode genuine creativity and make current art biased. 
On the other hand, some people believe, that power limitations will help to control expressions of modern art, because sometimes it is neccessary. There are a lot of examples, when products of some creative artist over-step the law. Moreover, some art expressions break the moral principles by propaganding non-ethic (sometimes violent) ideas. However, I tend to think, that such activity and its different, non-typical views seem to be only another, distinguished lifestyle, which doesn't mean immoral expressions, but conceptual. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress, that creative artists will always exists, and different opinions on freedom of their expressions will also exist. However, It's up to you to decide, what to think about it.
