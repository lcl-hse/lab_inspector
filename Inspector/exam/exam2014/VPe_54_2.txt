Nowadays there is a belief that suggest accepting the same amount of female and male students in every field of study. This means that we take into consideration not only academic performance of people but their gender too. 
The supporters of the idea believe that it is necessary to set up conditions, in which gender stereotypes can be ruined. They believe that after three ways of feminism it is important to give the ability to ambitious women as well as to men, who chose to take jobs, traditionally considered as a woman - type job, to realize themselves in a tolerant society. 
Moreover, the equal number of male and female students in classes provokes honest competition regardless gender stereotypes, they state. 
However, if we take a deeper look at the problem, we can notice that the proposed solution to ruin gender stereotypes involves positive discrimination first. Since we help a person to get into class we ourselves buit up new stereotypes. It becomes significantly difficult to get over gender stereotypes if it is not a success of a person to get into class but our help. We do want to have an example that would encourage people to find their best role and selfrealise. However, the more we set special conditions the bigger problem with gender stereotypes is. 
In my opinion, it is necessary to set the conditions that would allow any student to get into class based on his/her academic performance rather than stay for equal representation that stay for equal representation that build up new stereotypes such as "you would never get this place otherwise itself". We still have more to discuss to solve the gender stereotypes problems.
