Nowadays it is believed that universities should give the opportunity to study in to equal numbers of male and female students in every certain subject. 
On the one hand, some people claim that equality must be everywhere, especially in the case of studying. Firstly, some people have psychological problems, they do not feel themselves comfortable being surrounded by opposite sex. The equal number of men and women can be a solution to this problem, because a person will feel he or she is not alone and will always find a company. In addition, the equality of sexes was a topic worth-discussed during the whole history. The equal number of places for male and female may lead to opening new talants in the spheres that were concerned as only male or female. 
On the other hand, the sex must not be the most important grade in choosing a future student. Universities should give places to people who deserved them and it does not matter whether it is he or she. The most important and precious cryteria must be a level of intelligence and the abilities of student, his or her skills or talants. Moreover, it does not seem very fair to accept a girl instead of a boy who could be more talanted only because there are already enough boys. 
Personally, I believe that it is a very controversial issue worth-discussing and there can be many points of view. However, we must not forget that the university is place where people go to get new knowledges and there is no difference whether you are a male or a female student.
