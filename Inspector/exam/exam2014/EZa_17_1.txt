The given graph and pie chart illustrate the amount of electricity used daily in winter and summer and what this electricity is used for in England respectively. 
The graph shows that England uses more electricity in winter than in summer. The number of units of electricity is almost doubling in winter with the peak of 45000 units at about 22 o'clock. During summer daily maximum of casual used energy is 20000 units of electricity. 
A more detailed look at the pie chart states that heating something like rooms and water is the top priority of an english house going with 52,5%. The next three points are nearly equal. Those are ovens, kettles, etc, lightning, TV, radio and vacuum cleaners, electric tools. Ovens and kettles are slightly more important showing 17,5%. And the last two points both show 15%. 
To sume up, staying warm is very important and most of the energy is spent in this, doubling the number of consumed units of electricity in winter.
