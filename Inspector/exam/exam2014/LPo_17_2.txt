For centures people, espessially women, have argued about the same rights. This issue hasn't died yet and debates about difference of sexes exist in many social arias, for example, in universities. People argue about ability of boys and girls to study the same subjest. To my mind, universities should accept everyone on different faculties, and don't make a choise because of the sex. 
First of all, studing subjects on different themes wides of limits of thinking. This practice of reading or learning about something else will influence well on skills to communicade, for example, person, who study male and female subjects can keep a conversation, will have respect amond friends and relatives, will have chance to get a glamorous job and succesfully realized. 
Secondly, studing subject of another sex can can make person independent in everyday life. For example, if woman knows about fixing, she will be able to repair brocken thing at home by herself, without calling a neighbour or friend. 
Thirdly, students should change their working sphere be themselves, and sex has not to play any role in future activity. 
But there are those, who cannot agree with me, they claim that dividing subjects on male and female should be, because in this way the differences between men and women seriosly, becouse this situation will never be.
