Some people from different countries tend to spend their time on travelling or working after school and before starting university studies. 
In my opinion it is the exellent way to spend their spare time. First of all, you have the perfect opportunity to see the world,make new friendship, or indroduse with different cultures. If you decided to to work before stufying in university, you can get job experience in some organisations or companies. Secondly, it is the best time to decide fow your own what is really need to do and what do you want to achieve in your life. When you have a wife, two children and job it means that you cannot alive yur family and travelling by your own, because you understand that you should protect and save your relatives. Thirdly, after finishing high school you can choose which way is better to you. Maybe you will never continue your study and find some more opportunity to live. 
But this way have disagvantages. Firstly, in this time you can end first step in you university and it will be better for ypur diploma. Faster you finish the university- fester you will start your career. Secondly, you can only lose it time and don't even decide what you want. 
One of my friend worked all year after hight school abd then she got a green card to travel around the world. She was so exited after this and now she is studying in university very well. I think it is the great way to spend this time between finishing high school and starting university studies because you get an exellent experience which you nwill never forget.
