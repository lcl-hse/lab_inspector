Nowadays the problem of sexes often arrise in the society, for example, there is a matter of enrolling to university and some people say that equal amount of males and females should be accepted for each faculty. I partly agree with this statement. 
On the one side, such propotiton makes both sexes equal in their rights and thus helps to decrease irigrality in our society. Moreover, it makes us overlook the old myth of male or female jobs only and gives a chance to develop a natural talent in a person who is not suited for a particular work, according to the overall belief. Finally, it might help to percicre women more seriously further on in their work, for example in such male dominated area as bussiness. 
On the other side, there are some general tendencies in which subjects are most interesting or easier for a man and a woman. While most men are more interested in mechanics and engeneering, the majoritu of women migh prefer more creative or social subjects like art or psycology. For example, I am a student at philology faculty that studies literature and there are around 99% of girls in my group, which I find natural because girls tend to be more attracted to literature and language subjects than boys. It would be wrong to force someone to persue a certain career or subject just because we are trying to express iquality in such way, and there will always be such faculties that will attract uneven amount of males and females. Furthermore, accepting another talentless girl to a math department, for example, because of the stated amount of female students might lead to leaving out another gifted boy that was unlucky to be the one over the needed amount of males. 
To conclude, it can be said that introducing the same rules and standarts for accepting both sexes would be right thing to do. However, it should not be reflected in the strict numbers of students of each sex as it does not always help the purpose and can introduce more nolence.
