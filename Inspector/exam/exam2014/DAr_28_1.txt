The diagrams in the picture illustrates the situation in Yemen and Italy: the number of people at different ages in 2000 and predicted information for 2050. The first two charts show that it becomes more people in 2050 at 15-59 years old and at 60 and older. However, the information in the picture also shows that the percentage of children will dicrease. The second two diagrams illustrate that a part of children and people at the age 15-59 becomes smaller. Only number of old people will raise: the percentage of them from 24,1 will be turn to 42,3. This information discribes the several things. Firstly, it can be said that increasing number of old people in both countries in future can be caused by better level of public health. Secondly, we should say, that in future less people will prefer to have children in Yemen and Italy. Finaly, in can be noticed that despite the fact that Yemen and Italy are far from each other they will have the same situations in future.
