Wonderful artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. 
Overall, I agree with this opinion, because I believe in it. The creative artists must be given the freedom to express their good ideas. 
The first hight that needs to be said is the majority of people think that creative artists must have big talant and they have created ideas. Therefore they made wonderful pictures, fantastic music and great film, say beautiful phrases and words. The beautiful and creative things made good mood and people become happy. This is main cause of freedom in work of creative artists. Nobody mustn't.
