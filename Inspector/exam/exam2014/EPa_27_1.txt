The graphs show the predictions of how the ages of the population will change by 2050 in Yemen and Italy. 
In 2000 the number of young people under the age of 14 was slightly more than a half. In comparison, in Italy there are only 14,3% of people under the age of 14. In Italy there seemed to be more people over the age of 60 than in Yemen, and this tendecy is predicted to exist in the future. By 2050 the number of the elder people in Yemen is likely to rise from 3,6% to 5,7%, and in Italy the proportion is predicted to be 42,3%. The amount of young people is going to lessen in both countries. The number of people between the ages of 15 and 59 is predicted to increase in case of Yemen and stay at 57,3% in 2050. As for the Italy, the situation seems to be the opposite: the figures show that there will be about 15% less middle-aged people. 
In conclusion, we can see that in Yemen there will be less young people under the age of 14, but more middle-aged people. In addition, the population of Italy is predicted to become older, with approximately a half of people over the age of 60.
