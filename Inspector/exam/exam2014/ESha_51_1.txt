Four diagrams describe the number of different ages of population of Italy and Yemen in 2000 and outline predictions for 2050. It should be noted that the persantage of people who older than 60 years old will demonstrate a global growth for Italy, approximately for twenty percent, which as a result decline the quantity of people aged between fifteen and fiftynine years old. The total percantage of such people decrease from sixty one percent to fourty six persent, which means 15% loss from total quantity. There will also be a slight decrease in number of country members aging less than fourteen years. 
Describing the situation with Yemen, it could be underlined that the predictions show gradual growth in percantage of middleaged people by 2050. This growth determines the decline of percantage of youngest members of society, but the number of oldest people will be much more stable and will demonstrate insignificant growth for about two percent.
