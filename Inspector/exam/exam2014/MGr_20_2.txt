It is generaly agreed today that happiness is vey important part of our life. In some situations you can succed only being happy. I agree with this statement. I can confirm my opinion with following arguments. 
To begin with, happiness influence to our succes in a work sphere. You can be a good worker only if you like what you are doing. Because, the majority part of our lifes we are working. 
Morover, our happines depends on some factors such as famaly and love. All people need it. With out it they can't be happy. Love makes our lifes. 
In addition, other component of our happiness is to communicate with other people and have friends. Because communication takes the secon place in spending our time. Every day we need to talk with each other. 
Most of all to be happy we need to be reach. If we have some money we have more apportunities and possibilities. Such as spending time like we want. 
In conclusion, I want to say that every one need to be happy. Happinies has some components, but we need to realize all of them. Happiness is our succes.
