Pie charts given in the task represents some information about different proportions between age groups till time in two countries: Italy and Yemen. 
So, if we look at the different countrie's statistics we can conclude that there's a huge difference in young and old-aged people: on both today's chart and projection there's over than six times more eldery in Italy and over than 3 times more young-aged individuals in Yemen. If we compare changes that will probably take place in the future (2050), than one thing is being noticed pretty well: number of people aged sixty and more will be rising till time in both countries. Here's a probable explanation for such kind of phenomena: science (especially biology and medicine) researches will finally lead mankind to externed life length. 
All in all, we can clearly see that Italian sitizen's life length is obviously longer, but our humanity will live longer in 50 years anyway.
