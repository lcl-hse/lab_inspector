As it can be seen in the graph, we will compare the percentage of the retired and old population of the USA, Japan and Sweden. We are not just suggested to observe the situation from 1940 up till now but we also have a prediction about the future changes up till 2040. So lot's by to analyse the 1 century changes. 
If we look at the graph, which demonstrates Japan's trend, we will see, that from 1940 to 1960 here was a small downward trend which then led to 20-years stability. Just after that we can observe the gradual upward trend which changed by the rapid growth in 2020. So up till to 2040 the amount of population aged 65 and over will reach its peak and will be about 30%. 
Now, let's have a look at the U.S.A. and Sweden graphs. As we can see there are some common trends. Both graphs at the beginning, had quite sharped growths and then in 1980 there were slight decreases. But it's obvious that Sweden's decrease lasted rather shorter than American one. So if the USA slight decrease lasts rather shorter than American one. So if the USA slight decrease lasts approximately 40 years. Sweden's one lasts only 10 years. Then during 30 years in Sweden we can observe the clear upward trend, however there were some fluctuations. Speaking about American situation after the decrease it is seen that gradual grouth started. Now, if we compare the Sweden situation and American one, despite they developed practically the same way, Sweden, first, was lower than the USA, but in the future it is demonstrated, that Sweden will gather paces and will be ahead of America. 
To sum it up, the Japan trend has its own way of development and Sweden's and America's trends have something in common. In the future it is predicted that the absolute leader of the proportion of population aged 65 and over will be Japan at the level of 30%, then it will be Sweden with its 25%, and how it sounds strange, America will be the last.
