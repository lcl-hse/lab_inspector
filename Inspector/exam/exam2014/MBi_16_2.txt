A lot of people think that amount of male and female students in universities should be equal in all subjects. 
On the one hand, an equal number of male and female students can help teacher. There is a method which often practices in schools: boy seat with girls. This helps to lead pupils' attention on studying and not to playing and talking with each other. Moreover an equal numbers of male and female students can help with a later work in companies where will not be too many male and female employers. Furthermore the number of male and female students influences on a problem of future generation: if there are an equal numbers of students they have more chances to find their couple and maybe create a family. 
On the other hand it sounds impossible to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. For example, math and literature are too different subjects which choose usualy the majority of male (in case of math) and female (in case of literature) students. Furthermore from the world statistics we can know that there are more women than men in the world. In addition there are unpredictable situations like army for male students and decrets for female. It means that universities can accept equal numbers of male and female students but the number of them will change during the study and it will be impossible to save an equal numbers of students. 
In conclusion an equal numbers of male and female students in every subject hase advantages and disadvantages. However it anyway sounds impossible to universities to accept students this way. It depends on differenr unpredictable situations, students preferences and on an amount of women and men in the world.
