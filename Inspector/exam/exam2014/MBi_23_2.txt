Nowadays the problem of equality of two sexes is discussing worldwide. One of the aspects of this problem is a number of male and female students in universities. Some people think, that the number of female students should be stricktly limited, while others claim for equal numbers of students, regardless of their gender. In my opinion, the rights of women should be respected everywhere, whether it concerns universities or some other places. 
First of all, women should be given the same chances to develop their academic ability as the men do, because of the fact, that they could be as much talanted as the male students. Many scientists, for example, Mary Skladovskay-Kury, were woman and succeded greatly in their academic work and made some important inventions. 
Furthermore, there is no reason to limite the number of female students because in modern world the gender means almost nothing when we face with some serious problems, such as environmental crisis or the growing number of starving people in Africa. Male and female students after graduating have the same opportunities to find a job and all, what is important there, is the real level of their education. 
In addition, the history shows that the problem of equal rights for men and women has always had a dangerous consequences, when being silenced. The man and woman differ from each other with their bodies, not their intelligence. 
To sum up, the rights of women and the problem of number of male and female students in universities is worth discussing issue. The modern society, as I think, is tolerant enough to give women the equal chances to educate themselves, to work in different places, to investigate some interesting scientifical issues. Thus the discussion of gender problems is one the most important issue in Russia as well as in other countries, the situation could change.
