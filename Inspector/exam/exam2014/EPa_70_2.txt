In modern world there are a lot of people who think that it is good for public health to increase the number of sport facilities. But there are people who consider thet this would have little effect. 
As for people who consider thet we shoudl increase sport facilities they consider that sport is life. People who do sport more strong, shape, young, they more healthy. Sport helps than to increase their activity, it helps people to be in good mood. Everyday sport excercise help people do not ill. It is important to give people more apportunities for doing it. 
But there are people who thinc that we have anough apportunities for doing sport. If we have more facilities for sport it will can lead to bad consequinces. First of all sport can be very dangerous. It can lead to injory and then people can die. It would be more use full if people will try do medecine the best. Also if ecology polution is decrease people will be more helthy. Government shoud care about people. It should prepare a lot of program for improving public health. It will be more effective. 
In my opinion both side are right. Government should care about people. It should spend a lot of time and money for improving public helth. Government should build hospital and special medicine centre. It should not e expensive for people. Moreover people should do sport. It is also very important. People who do sport alwais have good shape, good mood, good health.
