There are many schools all over the world that come across students non-proper behaviour problems. As all people have to study at school and live a school life, this problem is extremelly important to be brought up. 
In my opinion there are different kinds of reasons of problems with student behaviour. First of all every persons way of behaviour is formed by his family, by the people he is surrounded every day. These people have a strong influence on the person and, as usually children are used to taking after parents, give non-written instructions to a person. Secondly, the atmosphere in school itself is important. If students are not involved into the school live, different activities, they may feel lost and start to act up, answer back to others and so on. Among with school activities studying process is mere important. Studying must be interesting and useful, but if it is not a round of problems may occur that students have to come through. 
If the reasons of students bad behaviour are clear there has to be a solution of it. To my mind we should always start with the family. It would be very wise of parents to spend time with their children, explaining what is right and what is wrong, in this way they can be prepaired to any social life. Secondly, teachers in school should try to orginise varios of activities for children, espesially for the smallest ones, to invent some sport competitions, intelligence quisses and so on. Third, it would be great if lessons encoureged students to study, if teachers managed to make these lessons usefull and to teach them those things that they really need in life. 
To sum it up, while people are young and study at school, they may not know some ways of proper behaviour and this causes some problems. But there is always a way out of it. In such situations there is noone but grown up people, such as teachers and parents, who can help students to improve their way of behaviour.
