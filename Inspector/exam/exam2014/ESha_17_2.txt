The art have important cause of our life. Talanted people who bring their own ideas for world aproximately changed our history. 
The most considerably point of art - it is a freedom. If the painter or writer don't have a freedom when he made some works. It is broke the conception of art. 
When we looked at russian history, we can see that goverments don't gave the permission for a freedom. And in this step of history people create a similar kinds of arts. Also, people who has a freedom on create always change our life. For example, leonardo Da Vinci, famouse engeneer, paiter and filosophier create a new kind of painting and improved the rules of painting. 
By the contrast, I think that freedom not always a good desigion in creating of something. If people had a permission to express or designed all of their own ideas, it is provide a harmful meaning all of arts. 
Overall, Art has a emotional influence for people, and when we can see harmful pictures or films in has negative effect for our mind. 
In my view, freedom - it is a important thing in art, but we can write moral restrictions for artists.
