All people want to be happy, but there are so many different ways to become satisfacted, is it the same things or happiness is something speciall. To my mind some simple things can make people feel good and this things are part of human happiness. 
Some people think that happiness depends on how mach money you have, others belueve thet if you have a great health you will be happy, but if yiu had some money to buy a flat and maybe a house to go there for weekends, will you be extremely happy? Also, tyhere are so many things to buy, but often people wants to buy more and more. Unfortunately they become depressed if they can't buy something. 
On tyhe other hand, some small things can give us many positive emotions, like your son when he get a good mark at school or your favourite dog. So to be happy at the moment you can just be with your loved person or your family. 
In conclusion I want to say that as many person people as many opinions. Each person me or you understands happiness in different ways, but if yoiu know what you need to be happy, please do it! There are so many factors such as health, money your family, all of this makes people believe in good future and be happy at the moment. It is personal decision to be happy now and be pleased or make plans on the future how to get more money and be able to do what you want.
