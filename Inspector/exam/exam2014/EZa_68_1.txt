The given chart gives information about the percentage between men and women at levels of post school qualification in Australia in the duration of 1999. 
In skilled vocational diploma men dominated dramatically by reaching 90% innstead of women which are only 10%. The figures changed in undergraduate diplomas. In this section women prevalied at 70% instead of men whose their figure peacked at 40%. As for as it concerned to bachelor's degrees the deference was slightly between two sexes. The numbet of women was at 55% and the number of men was at 45%. Men prevalied also in postgraduate diploma and master degree. Their numbers were at 70% and 60%. Women some lower - 30% and 40%. 
Overall, the chart illustrates that the proportion of men having a post-school qualification is much bigger than that of women. It is so interesting fact, and I do hope that the whole procent will reached new achieve.
