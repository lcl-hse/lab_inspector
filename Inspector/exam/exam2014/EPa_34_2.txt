A lot of people are interested in the improving their health. However, there is no one universal way to do it. So people's opinions are mixed and sometimes unobjective. 
Some people say that sport facilities are increasing public health and it's own on the one hand it could really help to destroy such desiese as overweight, etc. today sientists approve that everyday sport training could help people with Alzgaimer disiear. For example, when you want to improve your imuno you should just sport more time every day. 
On the over hand health is a siruose thing in our lifes. It is wrong way to think that sport will save you if you are ill. Sport should be in complex with overimproving things. For example, vitamins, food, unstresful or just less stresfull work, usefull relaxation such as walking, reading (helps to improve your memory) and so on. 
I think that in our country public health is in the great denage. Russian population is decreasing from year to year. Main problems are alchogolism and drugaddiction. It is obverouse that sport could not helps in such situation alone. But it is naturaly that sport facilities could improve situation a little. In whole I am sure that sport is good way to improve public health and good way to unite people with very differenrt lives and views. For instance, Olympic games which were already held in our country improve not only sport facilities and so public health but international connects (contacts) with people from different cities and countries.
