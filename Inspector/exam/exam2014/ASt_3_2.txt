Some people think that number of students of different sexes in universities should be equal in every subject. Other finds this idea stupid. I do not agree with the first one but looked for something interesting in their opinion. 
To begin with, I would like to provide the arguments in benefit of the first point of view. Firstly, if there is different numbers of male and female students then some of them, for example, those who are less in number, may feel uncomfortable. Secondly, girls which have not many friends-girs may feel shy and conversate and interact with the boys and controversary. And thirdly, I have a friend who has no girls in his university group. I really cannot imagine how hard is it to study without the beautiful sex. 
Now, I would like to stay on the second point oh view. Firstly, consider, for example, following abstract situation. There are 100 boys and only 1 girl which want to enter some university on definite speciallity. What should the university do? Accept only 1 girl and 1 boy? That is silly. That means that in some cases there would be no demand from only girls or only boys on some subject. That is normal because naturally we are different. That is the second argument. And the third is that in some cases girls may affect on boys' successes in study or again controversary. 
To sum up, I would like to underline that the education system should not differ boys and girls, so why should it keep their number equal?
