Nowadays more and more artists try to express their ideas through an extraodinary ways. Some people like it, the others claim that government should prevent us from this artists because they can hurt us, so they think that artist should express their views according to rules, laws. 
To begin with, I want to note that we live in literal society where the freedom of expression is one of the most important statement in the Constitution. So, artists could express their view in whichever way they wish. Moreover, maybe society will love such an extraodinary ways like graffity. For example: the story of Banxy. He started to paint graffity on different buildings in London. However, British laws permitted to do it, so he did not write his name and nobody know who he is until ourdays. His graffity paints were so magnificent that British government decided to call them art and made some exhibitions on them. Nowaday people are wonder of Banxy's paints and pay a lot of money for tickets. 
However, there are people who think differently. They claim that government should restrict artist from an extraodinary ways of expression their own ideas. They think that all graffity paints garbage view of their town. They argue that freedom of expression hurt their own freedom and their life safety. Moreover, they say that artists' ways of expression their views can hurt ideas of normal people. For eample, we can remember of the story of "Pussy Riot". They wanted to sign bad songs in the Jesus Christ Cathedral, however, they did not think about other people, so they were accested and sent to the prison. The huge part of our society think that it was right desicion. 
To sum it up, I want to note that if artist want to express himself he should first think about other people attitude and only then try to express himself in different ways.
