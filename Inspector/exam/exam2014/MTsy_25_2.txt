Nowadays there are a lot of people who consider that the increasing the number of sport facilities is the best way to improve public health. Others think that some different ways will be more effective. 
On the one hand, of course, sports should be more popular and people who are intrested in it should try to spread it all over their towns and countries. The increasing the number of facilities is a really good way to improve public health, because more people will have an opportunity to do sport and to keep them fit. Moreover, if the number of facilities rise, more children will have a chance to try some sport activity, it is also right for older people for example more than 60 years old. Furthermore, in the great number of facilities everyone can find a comfortable time to do sport. 
On the other hand, the reasons for doing sports are personal for everyone. Moreover, public health depends not only on sport. For example, rising the number of cheap restaurants with healthy food can improve public health too. Today there are a lot people who prefer junky and unhealthy food like hamburgers and french fries. This fact has very harmful influence on public health. One more important thing that influence on health is air pollution and pollution problems at all, so there are a lot of global problems in the world which should be solved for improving public health. 
To sum up, it is difficult to give a clear-cut solution to this problem. in my opinion, increasing the number of sports facilities is a good way to improve public health, but not the best.
