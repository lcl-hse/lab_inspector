The bar chart illustrates us the diversity in the levels of post-school qualifications in Australia between men and women in 1999. 
According to the chart there was a significant difference between genders in holding a skilled vocational diploma: approximately 89% of males had such post-school qualification, whereas only 10% of females got such diploma. Almost the same situation can be seen in people who held a postgraduate diploma, there was a big gap between men and women: about 70% against 30% correspondingly. 
On the other hand, about 70% of females had an undergraduate diploma, whereas only 35% of males had such qualification. Moreover, approximately 55% of women held a Bachelor's degree and 45% of men succeeded in achieving this qualification. 
In conlusion, in 1999, as the bar chart shows, males held more post-school qualification than women.
