Much can be said about unpaid community services. And many people say that such services should be included in high school. The most popular ideas have always been causing very exciting discussionsand debates. Personally, I agree with the statement that such programes should be included and students should spend their time on altruistic jobs. 
Firstly, we all do realise that working for a charity, helping old people, taking care about animals, which live on streets, are very important for our society. 
The other think is that such occupation allow students to feel all good and bad sides of our world. It extend their life views. 
Furthermore, many students will choose their future job. Becouse such practise may help them to understand that there are a lot of occupations, which change our world. The other equally important aspect is that unpaid services give a chance to understand that money is not the only reason for working.
