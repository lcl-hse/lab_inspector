Given pie charts show percentage of people of different ages based on information from 2000 and predictions for 2050. It can clearly be seen as we look at all 4 diagrams that population in both countries will be getting older. The percentage of kinds and teenagers will gradually go down in Italy and will have a more rapid regression in Yemen. Italy population was already quite older than Yemen's in 2000. The European country had almost quarter of people in age over sixty, while in Yemen they made less than 4 per cent of total quantity and a little more than a half were in very young age. While not being wery high in 2000, in Italy the percentage of olders will rise almost by 20 percent and will make approximatly 4 times more people than the young generation. Yemen's majority in both charts consist of people younger than 59 (more than 90% in both cases), and Italy's majority are people aver 15 years old.
