At all times in he whole world freedom makes our life wonderfull and amazing. Freedoom, the wonderland for each artist's creativeness, can result in appearance of masterpieces in music, cinema and different types of art. Some people think that artists should be given to complete freedom to express their own plans and ideas. However, I do not agree with this idea. 
Frankly speaking, I should say that freedom gives those wings of imaginations so that their creativeness goes beyond every border and touches each person's soul. True artists always lead people towards truth, kindness and beauty and their creative values enriching people's life. 
However, it is not good idea that there should not be any restriction on ideas expressions of artists. Nowadays we live in 21 century and technologies make artistic works come to the publick easily and quicly. Besides good content compositions, some poor quality ones with meaningless lyrics or vulgar words released can have a bad influence on the community. In addition, nude art can be used to satisfy the dirty demands of some calling themselves artists. Therefore government should have detailed restricts and requirements on quality of artist works and artistic performances in order to prevent selling messages of bad lifestyle in society. 
In conclusion the government should encourage the creativeness of artists by honoring those with great contributions. However, detailed restrictions are necessary to provide a healthy development of national culture.
