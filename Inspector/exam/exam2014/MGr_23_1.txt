We have two graphics. The first one shows us a typical daily demand for electricity in England according to the winter of summer days. The second shows us what the electricity is used for. So, take a look for the first graphic. There we can see that using of electrisity is higher in winter days and the most hight point of it using is in the evening hours - more than 40000. In the summer days using of electrisity is not so high as in winter. The highest point of it using is 20000; morning hours. Now, take a look at the pie char of the second graphic. Here we can see that the biggest part of using electricity going to heating rooms and water 52,5%. 
From this state we can make a conclusion that using electricity in winter higher because such things as heating rooms and water take more power in winter that on summer.
