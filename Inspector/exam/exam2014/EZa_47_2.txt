The art is the important part of human's history, because from stoned times people draw pictures in their caves. And today art are transformed into something new and different, people call it a modern art. 
I partly agree with written statement about freedom of expressing for artists and government's restriction. 
Sometime modern artists make their works whichcould seem so disgusting or not allowed to show a young children, but creative artist don't think about it. For example, modern artistfrom Saint Petersburg who came to Moscow and nailed himself onto red square, moreover without any clothes. Also hedid something extraordinairy. He sewed up his lips with red strings. And as he said it was expressing hius ideas and it was his way of expressing himself. I absolutely sure, that he is not only one artist who make same things, so I believe it is unusual. 
But, on the other hand, there are as many interesting modern artists who make really perfect pictures, paintings and other thing. Also there are a street culture calked a Graffiti. People use spray paint and drow something on the walls of building and of fences. It looks cool but police and government not allow to do this, despiteto that fact that people like it and cand supportg their works, they can enjoy them. 
To sum up, creative artists heve not to irritate citizens and other ordinairy people, because if people will not support them it make no sence for all.
