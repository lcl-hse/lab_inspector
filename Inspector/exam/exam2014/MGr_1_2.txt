Some people believe that happiness is essential for people's lifes, but we cannot give the appropriate definition for it. So, there are some ways for achieving it and I will provide them in this essay, as well as, causes of impossibility if interpreting this notion. 
Generally, there is no one option about what happiness means for every person. People and tastes are differ and nobody can give universal formulation because of unfamiliar views. For instance, for one man to be happy means to be rich and have material wealth, for somebody else only intangible love and and affiliation are meaningful, moreover, third person focus his efforts solely on achieving his main goals and he will be happy after winning these small "games". From my point of view, such differences in perception can only make the topic of happiness in life more controversial due to individual search of it. 
Nevertheless, there are some factors that will help everybody to be happy. Simply, you should enjoy every day of living, certainly, there can be some terrible events and happenings, but they should not spoil your good mood. Moreover, person, wanting to get a piece of happiness should provide more hours with relatives and close people and do not spend all of the free time at work It was the recent survey resulting from a poll proving this point of view. 
In conclusion I want to say that in spite of impossibility of defining "happiness" it exists in the mind of every single person and you can reach it following some simple rules.
