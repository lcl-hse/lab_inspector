The health of people and nations is an important problem in our time. And there is a task: how to grow the level of people health? There are different opinions about this case. 
Some people see the solving of problem in increasing the number of sports facilities. Of course it is impotant step to the relevant way. Because the number of facilities can rise the possibilities of people to do sport. For instance, you can choose the more appropriate facility which responce of your requests and availability. 
On the other hand, people predicte the little effect of this and require the other measures. In same part they are right. In needs to use more stricte and global actions. For exemple, the propogand of the health style of life on the TV, on Internet and by advertisment. The government must to use the policy which tend attention to the question of nation health, and moreover the international policy must diclarate in whole world that we need to change an world for increase the level of health of all our generation. 
In my opinion both these points of view is correct and that we need to developping in these distinctions in one time. We need at first, that in minds of people will be the things about their health and that they desire to be more healthy and to learn they children in right way. Because the children are our futur. 
In conclusion, for get good resalts it is appropriate to use all measures which we see and which we can realise.
