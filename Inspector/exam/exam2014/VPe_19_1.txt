The bar graphs given illustrate the reasons for getting education among students of different ages and how employers supported them during their study. 
On the first graph the corelation between student's age and the main reason for study is represented. It can be clearly seen, that the amount of students studying for some career purpouses decreases with the age, and, on contrary, the number of those studying for interest increases and reaches the peak in the oldest age group. In the last but one group 40-49, both numbers are equal. 
On the second graph the information is shown about the employer's support. It achieves the highest position in the age group under 26, then goes down steedly to the lowest position for the group 30-39, and grows moderately in the last two groups. 
To sum up, the employer support slightly corelates with the wish of an employee to study for career purposes, but this tendency works only for young students. However, employers are also ready to help students of old age, who are mostly studying for their own interest.
