It is a matter of common knowledge that trough out our life we face different life experiences: both positive and negative. And there is No doubt that all of them have some influence on us, so we are changed with time going. And it is also a common knowledge that every person is born with some characteristics, which serve a background for forming of personality. As it is said, some resent researches had indicated that characteristics we are born with and the developed once have much more influence on our personality than any experiences we have in our life. I can't agree with this statement fooly. On the one hand, characteristics we are born with are very important I understand it for sure. You are born with them and they come to you from your percents and there is nothing you can do yo change them. But on the other hand, the experiences you Farr trough your development, because you develop together with your experiences and under their influence. My point of view, that any person can make out of itself a person he or she locents. But it takes a lot of time to works in order to form your personality. It is called window. And it comes in many years to those who works on themselfs and may never come to ones who don't care about theirs spirit and soul. 
But what I am totally sure in is that development together with life experience is much more stronger and important than the characteristics we are born with. And, for example, I myself try to get rid of the bad charactestics I was born with and to stronger the good inborn characteristics. I can't stay that I'm good at it yet, but I think that in many years, and through out every year, with every new experience. Finally I will change myself and be more like the "ideal" personality for me.
