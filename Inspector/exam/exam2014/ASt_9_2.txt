Nowadays democracy is almost in all spheres of lives of the citizens of more than half countries of the world. But still, it is not always about disputable issue of freedom to express personal ideas for some groups of people, for example, creative artists. 
On the one hand, I suppose that governments should provide freedom to express personal vision to every person in the state and this freedom has more pros than cons. Expressing your point of view in words, pictures and music gives you opportunity to tell your ideas to the millions. For instance, Visockiy shared his vision of life of ethic norms, politics, wars and other issues via music. And his music has changed and changes the lives of enormous number of people. In addition, creative artists can influence even the politics of whole countries and boost improvements and innovations. They can force their fans even to start a revolution in the country and put a good politic instead a dictator in the head of the country. 
On the other hand, restrictions should exist. We know many problems that had government of the USA with islamic countries because of provocative pictures and movies about Mohammed, for example. Also, nazy or other bad ideas can be promoted by creative artists and it can set the society back for many problems, such as nationalists in the government of Ukrain. 
To conclude, every coin has two sides and freedom to express personal ideas for creative artists is not an exception. But from my humble opinion, this freedom should be provided and even guaranteed by the constitutions of all countries, because there are more advantages than disadvantages.
