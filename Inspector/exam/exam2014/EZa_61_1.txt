The given chart presents the information about the different types of post-school qualification and percentages of men and women who had them in Australia in 1999. 
Itis noticeabke that skilled vocational diplomas, postgraduate diplomas and master's degrees were the most popular among men. In contrast, percentages of women who had undergraduate diplomas and bachelor's degrees were higher. 
In 1999 only 10 percent of women and almost 90 percent of men got the skilled vocational diplomas. As for undergraduate qualification, there the reverse situatioin is represented. Percentage of women was significantly higher than percentage of men: 70 percent against 35 percent. 
In bachelor's degree there was no strong difference according to gender: both 45 percent of men and 53 percent of women held this level of post-school qualification. Inthe next two levels, postgraduate qualification and master's degree, the superiority of men can be observed. There were much more men who held those two levels than women. 
Summarizing,it can be said that men in average were more likely to get different kinds of post-school qualification than women and this tendency wasn't observed only among the undergraduate diplomas' owners.
