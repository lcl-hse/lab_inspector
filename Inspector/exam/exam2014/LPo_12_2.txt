Nowadaz, we live in a world of fair competition. A great number of people from all over the world dream of having a good, high education in order to get a well paid job. In this case, many people claim that there should be an equal number of students of each sex, both male and female, in Universities in every subject. Personally, I am in two minds about this issue. 
On the one hand, without any doubt, it is a good idea for a plenty of reasons. First of all, it will be a perfect boost for developing tolerance in our society. Because, there wouldn't be jobs only for women and for men. And, so, it will destroy conflicts based on gender. Moreover, it will help our society to develop a lot of male areas, were women can be really usefull. In addition, such a measure can become a great socialisation tool. I firmly believe, that, for instance, on technical faculties, where the majority of students are men, equal number of female can make the study more interesting and productive. 
On the other hand, I am totally concerned, that such a situation is impossible. To begin with, I'd like to tell, that male and female has different type of mind. Maybe, that's why many boys tend to prefer technical subjects and science, while girls preder working with peopleand some not scientific subjests, such as history or sociology. Also, it is not fair at all. Why should we deny some boys or girls in order to make the situation in the university genderly equal? The competition should, and only strongest ones should be able to study in the university, and it isn't metter is it a man or woman. 
All in all, I must confess, that it is a quite complicated topic. But, I also think, that this idea is really unfair. In the tryings to destroy the gender boards, to make everybody equal, to make our society absolutely tolerant, people no longer fallow the human sence. In my firm belief, we must stop it before it is too late.
