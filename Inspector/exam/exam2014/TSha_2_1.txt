The linear graph demonstrates the development of number of senior citizens in three countries throughout a century. There are some interesting facts concerning the population of people aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden and the USA in the period between 1940 and 2040. 
The overall trend in each country is upward, though there is one exception to this which occured in Japan and lasted from 1940 till the beginning of 21st century. After this modest deep the proportion of retirees roared dramatically and constituded over a quarter at the end of the period. 
It is obvious that in the beginning of the period the fraction of senior citizens was less then 10%, with the USA having the largest share and Japan - the least. 
In the USA the number of people aged 65 and over fluctuated slightly and reached a plateau in the first 20 years of 21st century. Afterwards, there was a moderate increase with maximume of just under a quarter. 
Similar development may be observed in the proportion of senior citizens of Sweden. It is also worth pointing out that the number of this age group fluctuated throughout the whole period and reached a peak at approximately a quarter of the country's population.
