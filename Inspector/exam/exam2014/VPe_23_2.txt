Sometimes it is difficult for young people to decide what to do after graduating from the high school. When someone in their adolescence, every step and choice seems to be the most important, and every mistake seems to be a disaster. So should young people not to hurry with their decisions or it would be just a waste of their priceless time? 
On the one hand, it is believed that the young people are not mature enough just after finishing the high school. If after that they, for example,went travelling or started working, they would earn much experience form that. And, with such an experience, they definitely would find the job of their interest, something that they would love to do for their entire life. Moreover, they could find that they actually do not need further education and start, for example, their own business immediately, instead of wasting years for boring and useless univercity studying. 
On another hand, sometimes student just cannot afford that. In some countries it is almost impossible to find a job for the person with no higher education. And it is very rare that a young man or woman can afford travelling for a while year or even month, even with their family help. Furthermore, even if it is seemed that the university, in which you have possesses to apply, provides cources that will be absolutely useless in the future, it does not mean that it really does. Sometimes you get from the university something more than education. 
Coming to the conclusion, I would like to say that both points of view makes sense. The pause between graduation from the high school and going to the university has its advantages and disadvantages, so it is only the question of decision which every young man or woman should make on their own.
