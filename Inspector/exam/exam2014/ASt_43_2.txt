The question of what is more important for our personality experience or the characteristics we are born with is a reason for argue between people until today. 
Some people state that our essential skills have more influence on us than experience which we take year by year. This position is prooved by research. One of the main statement of those who agree with this point of view is that people cannot take more then their potential is. Moreover, if you are silly it is obvious that you do not have any chance to change your brain globally. Just because of your training you can only make your posibilities work on maximum but it will be lower level than the person with higher potential can achieve with a little training. 
The other point of view, is that if you want to be successful you should work hard and this will give you what you want to get. Furthermore, even if you have a huge potential but do nothing it is a waste of your talents. So good work can change you and if you are smart experience which you should keep and remember day by day this is your chance to be successful.
