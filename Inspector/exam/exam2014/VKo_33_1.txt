On this bar charts we can see different levels of post-school qualifications in Australia and the proportion of men and women who held them in 1999. 
First of all, we can see that men in 1999 dominated on women on such bar charts as the skilled vocational diploma (the percent of men is 9 times bigger than women), postgraduate diploma (the percent of women is a half of mens percentage) and master's degree diploma. Thus, there is a tendency that in 1999 most of men have low-educational diploma or top-educational (as master's degree, for example) compared to women results. 
Secondly, there is an another tendency - most of women prefered to take the undergraduate diploma or the bachelor's degree: 70 percent against 37 percent approximately and 53 percent approximately against 48 percents approximately. Therefore, women prefered to finish "middle-level" education, and did not take part in other qualifications as men. 
To sum up, in 1999 Australian men and women created a case, that shown us such tendency: in total, men prefered to pass the skilled vacational diploma or higher education qualifications, and women often completed such qualification as the undergraduate diploma or the bachelor's degree.
