Nowadays education is one of the most important parts of our life. We can't imagine our life without getting new information and new knowledges. Moreover, after school people tend to continue their education at universities. But some subjects can be more popular among the students. Furthermore, male and female students have different preferences and often choose different subject: That is why people try to find the answer: Should we accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject? 
In my opinion, we should choose only disciplines that we want to learn. And if male or female students tend to learn some subjects it is not a big problem for universities. For example, if someone wants to have a good salary and work as economist, it means that he or she should pull out all the stops in disciplines such as math or microeconomics. In other case, student can't work hard and try to be the best in subjects which he or she interested in. 
On the other hand there are some subjects that are popular only among male or female students. For example, some subjects that relate with Physics are extremly unpopular among women. But it doesn't mean that we have some problems in this branch of science. 
In conclusion, it is neccessary to add that people should have free choice of their future education and their futur job. Only in this case we can see outstanding results in every subject from all students.
