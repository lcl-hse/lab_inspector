Today the activity of volunteer organizations has grown significantly. The results of their working are shew on TV. There is far lot of information about them in newspapers and in the internet. So, the society has started to understand that a voluntary work can be used as a good tool for teaching young people. 
Firstly, unpaid voluntary work is useful for developing proper moral view and world view of a young people. There is no doubt that it develops kindness and it's a great chance for young people and scholars to try to help other people. What is more, scholars won't have to use their own private time on doing this, because it will be included in school lessons time. Rightly organized high school voluntary programmes could become a great help for moral steading of scholars. 
On the other hand, some people could naturally don't like to help others, especially unpaidly. But a lot of people don't like math, for example, but they have to study it because it's important for their personal development and it's a schoolar course. I can't see any stops to involve these voluntary school programmes and I definetly support this. Maybe, the next generation will become more kind because of these programmes.
