The graph provides data about the percentage of group of people 65 years old and over. It demonstrates a change of this proportion from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA. 
It's clear from the graph that in every compacative country the quantity of people 65 years old and over would increase from 5%-10% in 1940 to 25% approximately in 2040. However, the ways of growing are different. The percentage of population aged 65 and over in USA is guaducelly increasing during this 100 years like in Sweden. By contrast, Japan's group of people 65 years old and over had been decreasing from 1940 to 1983 approximately, then it began to rise slightly and in 2030 there would be drammatic increase from 10% to 25%. In USA and Sweden there were periods of decline too - from 1980 to 1990 and from 1980 to 2014 respectively. Moreover, next period of decrease of population aged 65 and over is expected in USA in 2015. 
As a result of change Japan will be the oldest country in 2040, then Sweden and USA respectively. It means that Japan will be in risk of demography problems.
