People need to feel happiness. It is important factor of our being and it is not so easy to become happy and understand how to catch happiness: For many people happiness is the way of the life and for the others it is something like supernatural thing. 
We should ask ourself what is happiness and what should we do for define it? Many philosophers thinks that the only one realy important business of our life is doing something to be happy. 
It means that every things that we do is pretend to makeus happy or unhappy. So, people are going to get happiness because happy people feel that their lifes are brilliant. The other theories prefer to analise the phenomen of happiness like only one of the ways to make your life important for you. You may not be happy, but you think that you done smth right and it helps you not warry. 
Howewer these are some simple methods of being happy: doing smth that you really want, triing to be kind with other people and don't lose your own time for thinking about past and future but doing smth today. All in all, our life has time limit and we should not lose even one day worrying about smth. 
On the other way, some people think that being happy with some lovely things in not enough for real all-life happiness. They needs smth extraordinary in their life. These persons try to make their beings propriate for others. This way people prefer to toose some things and opportunities for making some special decision like finding new science fact or building enormouth modern hospital or smth else. This need your time, healthiness and everyday pleasures, but you may done something realy interesting and perfect. 
So, firs of all, people should realise what kind od hapiness they want to feel and than start work for it.
