The data given shows the statistic information about the population aged 65 and over from 1940 to 2040 in a certain European country. 
It can be deduced from the graph that the population of Japan dropped from approximately 5% in 1940 to 3% in 1990 and than increased dramatically by the end of the period analyzed. In contrast, the amount of population aged 65 and over in USA increased from about 9% in 1940 to 27% in 2040. Similarly, the statistics of population of Sweden demonstrates the steady upward trend: from 7% in 1940 to approximately 25% in 2040. 
Overall, it can be said that the proportion of the population aged 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in Japan decreased and then increased dramatically while the situation in Sweden and USA was more stable: the information given demonstrates that the population increased by the end of the period.
