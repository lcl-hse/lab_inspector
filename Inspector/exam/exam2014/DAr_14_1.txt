These pie charts provide a summary of age structure of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and predictions about this structure in 2050. It is clear that a percentage of 0-14 y.o. and 15-59 y.o. in Yemen 2000 is almost equal. The chart also shows that a piece of 60+ y.o. is very small. Nevertheless, the chart of predictions for Yemen demonstrates a vast difference between 0-14 y.o. and 15-59 y.o. in the future with a huge advantage in favour of 15-59 y.o. At the same time a percentage of 60+ y.o. slightly rises. In contrast with Yemen, the Italian chart shows that the majority of people in 2000 belongs to the category of 15-59 y.o., while a piece of 0-14 y.o. is the lowest. It is also must be mentioned that 60+ y.o. people make a one fourth of Italian population in 2000. According to the predictions, a percentage of 60+ y.o. people will surge to almost a half of total population, meanwhile a percentage of 14 y.o. will gently fall. There is also a solid decrease in quantity of 15-59 y.o. people down to 46%. The overall trauds about these countries are different. While Yemen's 15-59 y.o. category is going to broaden, Italian is predicted to plunge.
