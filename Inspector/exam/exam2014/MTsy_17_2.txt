Someone would agree with the statement that increasing of number of sports facilities is the best way to make people healthier. In contrast, someone would offer better ways to improve public health. 
Everybody knows that those people who do regular sports exercises are much more healthier than those who don't. Nobody argues that sport is one of the most important parts of health way of life. In some big cities government build gyms and sports facilities that are available for everyone. Children can visit gyms at school as well as students can attend free sports classes at the university. Therefore it is very easy to find the possibility to do sports nowadays. 
However, doing sports is not the only way to become healthier. A healthy diet is also a very important part of healthy way of life. The truth is that a lot of people are too busy or lazy to visit gyms and do sports, so many would prefer to stop smoking and drinking alcohol, start eating more vegetables and fruits instead of making physical excercises. Therefore someone would say that the best way to improve public health is by popularising of healthy way of life which includes not only sports excercises. There are a lot of ways that are implemented to make this way of life more popular: for example, government can increase people's awareness of healthy diets or even of anatomy and biology knowledges. 
In my opinion, increasing the number of sports facilities is not the best way to make people healthier, because it is not convenient for everyone. A healthy way of life consists of a lot other methodics that might be more convenient especially for busy people. Instead of building sports gyms that will not be visited by people, government should popularise other ways of becoming healthier and stronger.
