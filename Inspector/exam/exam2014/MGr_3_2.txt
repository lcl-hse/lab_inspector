There are no clear definitions of the word "happiness". For some people it is associated with success, others believe that happiness is beauty. There are people who are sure that this word means to be the part of a team, others find happiness in their own. Nevertheless, this phenomena is considered very significant in life and achieving it can become the point of somebody's life. 
From my point of view, the word 'happiness' is difficult to define because it is closely connected with person's conditions of life, his system of relations or with his culture. For instance, there is no word 'happiness' in primitive societies and in case american or european people try to explain this word to north inhabitats, they would fail because for these people 'happiness' is the part of everyday reality. The have never thought about philosophical aspects of this world. 
The main point of the world "happiness' differs from country to country. East cultures, such as Japan or China, connect it with collective actions. By contrast, in Europe achieving happiness means career success or good family relations of a concret person. 
The difficulties of defining happiness are also connected with time aspects. Happiness can means feeling good "here and now" or feeling satisfaction during years. 
However, some factors of happiness are equal for different countries. For example, they are health, ecology, wealth and family relations. More than that, living among happy people in a successful country also makes people happier. 
To sum up, defining the word "happiness" differs from one person to another and it is up to system of personal aims. Happiness is an important part of life and for some people it means living this minute, because it comes from millions of others and there's no better than here and now, but for others it means finding your own place in the life. Happiness is the feeling that makes life better.
