Someones believe that it is better for public health to increase an amount of sport facilities. Others, however, suppose it would be useless. How should be solved this problem? 
In the first point of view, the more sports facilities there are, the more sports facilities are, the more healthier are people. This opinion has reasons for being alive, because to make people to do sport government should provide a place for it. Also the variety of choice can help people to start care about their health. Moreover, not everybody has an opportunity to go in centre of the city every time they want to do sport and the near sportclub can help citizens to manage to be health. 
On the other hand, nobody can be sure, that the raise of quantity of sports facilities will have an impact on intristic motivation of people. The problem is more deep and the answer is not on shallow. If there is a sport club near the person's house, it doesn't mean that the person will desire to care his or her health. People need to be engaded in the sport activity with another ways too. For example, my mother did not want to go to the sport centre until her friend agrees to go with her together. About another example I read on the last week. The children did not want to play on the tennis court and came only because they were pressed by their parents. But the tennis instructor made a decision to implement some fun in the system and made up a hero for everyone. earn badges and clothes for their heroes, children had to play well on the lessons. So, in these cases motivation was high, as social aspects and fun during the process play a significant role. 
To sum up, I suppose, that increase of number of sports facilities is not enogh for improving the public health. But there are many other ways to do it, which are more effective and sucsessful. It proves, not in the first time, that quality is more important than quantity.
