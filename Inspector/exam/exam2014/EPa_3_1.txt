Two of four diagrams show humanity percentages of different ages in Yemen and Italy in 2000. Another two charts illustrate some forecasts for 2050. We can see that population if these two countries is divided into three groups. I will call people who are 0-14 years - young people, who are 15-59 years - middle-aged people and who are 60+ years - retired people. 
Firstly, we can see than in Yemen the number of middle-aged people will rise on 11% in 2050, while in Italy number of middle-aged people will drop from 61,6% to 46,2%. Number of young people in Yemen is larger than in Italy on about 35,8%, but number of retired people in Yemen is little, only 3,6%, while in Italy is 14,3% in 2000. In both countries number of young people will go down by 2050, but in Yemen decreas in young population is bigger than in Italy. Also we can notice that in both countries there is tendency of increasing retired people, but in Italy it will increase more than in Yemen in 2050.
