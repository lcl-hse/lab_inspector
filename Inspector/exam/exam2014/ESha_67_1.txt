The pies below illustretes the growth on the reduction of the population of Italy and Yemen from 2000 to 2050 years. 
It is important to notice, that in all the years there will be the biggest amount of people from 15 to 59 years in Italy. (teenagers young people and middle aged) In Yemen that number will increase from 46,3% to 57.3% during the period. At the same time that figure will fall in Italy from 61,6% to 46,2%. The reason of that decrease is growth of old generation (60+ years). If in 2000 that number reached 24,1%, in 2050 it climbed to 42,3%, what is two times more. What about Yemen, the figure of retired people is quite low and will stay quite static (from 3,6% in 2000 to 5,9% in 2050). On the one hand the young generation will decrease in Yemen in 1/3, on the other hand in Italy we can see the same fall. 
To sum up, it is necessary to report the main tandencies : the growth of the people from 15 to 59 years, the decrease of young generation, and the improvement of old people in Italy.
