I'd like to begin with, some people may think that it is a good idea to force high school students to participate in unpaid community services, because they could learn valuable lessons. 
I think life skills are very important and by doing voluntary work, students can learn how to communicate with others and work in a team, but also how to manage their time and improve their organizational skills. Nowadays, teenagers don't have many after schools activities. After school clubs are no longer that popular and students mostly go home and sit in front of TV or play video games. 
By giving them compulsory work activities with charitable or community activities, they will be encouraged to do something more creative. Students will also demanding more respect towards work and money as they realize that it is not only that easy to earn them and hopefully will learn to spend them in more practical way. Healthy life balance are strongly promoted and therefore any kind of spare time charity work will prevent from sitting and doing nothing. 
In conclusion, I'd like to say that it is a very good idea, and I hope that this programm will be sucsessful.
