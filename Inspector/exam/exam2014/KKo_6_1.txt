The pie charts illustrate the demographic situation in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and give predictions for 2050. 
A closer look at charts reveals the number of medium-aged and elderly people is predicted to increase. Although, the number of young citizens of Yemen is expected to decrease and will reach only 37% in 2050. 
In contrast, in Italy the number of medium-aged persons is projected to decline from 61.6% to 46.2%. Also the scientists predict a sharp increase in elderly people. There will probably be 42.3% of old citizens in 2050. However, the number of young people is expected to decrease, but it will by nearly 3% not by 15% as it expects in Yemen. 
Overall, the demographic situation in Yemen differs from the situation in Italy. Therefore, there are quite different predictions for future datas and the charts reflect not similar tendencies on the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy.
