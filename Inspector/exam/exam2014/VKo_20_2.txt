Nowadays the issue about artists' freedom in their work has become a topic of lively debates. Some people think that artists should always be given absolute freedom of expression their opinions and ideas, whereas others consider that government should control this process and make some restrictions toward creative class. 
On the one hand, all people were born equal with equal rights and freedoms. Constitutions of many countries provide people with the right to express their ideas and views and do it free. Moreover, a lot of world masterpieces were created as act of the expression of the opinion of the whole nation in order to grab government's attention to some exiting problems. Therefore, sometimes free art can be not only attractive, but also useful. 
On the other hand, history knows examples of free art, when it overstepted the frames of law and violated human rights. Different ideologies were often propaganded through the words, pictures, music and films. Creative artists definitely should be given some freedom or they couldnot create at all, but government should be aware of that art. 
Taking everything into account, I want to say, that although there are a lot of pros and cons of that freedom, I strongly believe that cons are outweigh. I'm sure, that government should make some adequate restrictions, in the frames of which artists can do whatever they want. It is a kind of compromise. Government should always remember of the freedom of art and artists should not forget about the law.
