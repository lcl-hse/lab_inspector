happiness is a really nice word with great problems to explain whatnit exactly is. You can hardly disagree that it is very important to be happy but when you ask people how it is to be happy and what they need to be happy, you may soon understand that everybody put their own meaning in the word "happy". 
At the same time you can also find the main factors wich make people be happy. First of all, everybody wants to deal with stress. It's simply to understand - of you don't want to have any problems with your school or work. There are some people who want to be rich or just have a little more money than they have now. The other want a good health. But just ask yourselves, is it the real happiness? 
I suppose that the main problem with happiness is that nobody knows what he or she really wants. I don't remember how to say it correctly, but one author said "The happiness is not to lose the possibility to wait your happiness". In my opinion it's more important to have the possibility than just thinking about what happiness exactly is. There is one truth about happiness at all - nobody knows what it is and everybody find it in very different ways. No one can tell you how to be happy besides you. 
In conclusion I want to say that if you know what happiness is - it isn't real happiness. No one knows how you can be happy even if they are happy themselves. It's your own way - how to be happy and I can't say what factors are important to to be happy because I'm not you and you aren't me.
