Nowadays a lot of scientists are trying to figure out the influence on our personality of some characteristics that we obtain from our birthday. There is no clear answer on the question about the main factor influencing human character. In my point of view the difference between our life experience and practice has much more effect on the difference in our personalities than some genetical characteristics. 
First of all, there is a list of psychological schools based on idea that human's personality forms in our childhood. A lot of psychological diseases can be defeated if their cause is found in the beginning of patient's life and all of this is a proved and well-knowed fact. 
Secondly, our development usually depends on the way of growing us as a childs. If one's parents pay a lot of attention to education of their child, there are more chances for their son or daughter to be successful in the school or university because she or he used to get new information a lot. 
Furthermore, a lot of our behaviour patterns are nothing more than reaction to some events that happened in our lifes. Such personality charasteristic as trust to other people can be ruined at all after being cheated by somebody close to you. Such thing as permanent aggression can appear after being defeated at some professional sphere etc. 
To conclude, surely, there are a lot of basic instincts and some genetic characteristics that affect our personality, but I think that it is life experience that have the most significant influence on our personality.
