It is widely believed that sport can improve public health. Extra polating from that some people state that by increasing the number of sport facilities goverment will automaticly improve public health. Oposite to this point of view some people belive that just by increasing the number of sports facilities the goverment achive the effect expected. Let us have closer look into this problem. People who belive that the best way to improve public health is to build more sport facilities also belive that there is high level of demand for sports in the society. Therefore by increasing the number of sport facilities the goverment would simply futhfill the existing demand which in long term perioud would decrease the number of people with bad habits as well as make society more sports and heaths. Oposing this point of view there exists a differnt one. It is stated that the society is not at all characterized by having high demand for sport activities; and as it is not (as belived by a number of people) by increasing the number of sport facilities goverment wouldn't achive much. Derriving from that it is belived that rather than building more sport facilities goverment should concetrate on increasing the demand for sport activities in the society by having more physical education lessons in schools, advertising sports and promoting healthy lifestyle. It is also belived that the money that are to be spent on building sports facilities are better of to be interested into healthcare. Concluding the topic I'd like to say that increasing the number of sport facilities seems to be very good idea and that I can't wait for a new football pitch to be opened near by a place where I live.
