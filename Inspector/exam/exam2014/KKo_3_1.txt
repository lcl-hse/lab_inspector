The charts illustrate the percentage of the different age groups in 2000 who lived in Yemen and Italy. Also, it gives a prediction for 2050 for both countries. 
First of all, more than half of the population of Yemen in 2000 were between 0 and 14 years. In comparison, Italy had the biggest percentage of people between 15 and 59 years (61.6%, more than a half). 
Secondary, it's necessary to pay attention to the fact that Yemen in 2000 had an extremely small percentage of 60+ years old people. In comparison, Italy had 24.1%, which is approximately a quarter of the whole population. 
The prediction for Yemen is quite reasonable, because the percentage of people aged between 15-59 years is going to grow (from 46.3% to 57.3%) and will be more than a half. However, the prediction for Italy is not so positive, because the number of people aged 60+ years is going to be almost doubled. 
To sum up, the age percentage and the proportion of the population is going to change in both countries, but in quite different ways.
