That won't be an exagerration to say that art is what makes our life brightful and fills it with beauty and emotions. It often touches upon social problems and a lot of people of art are sure that the main purpose of their activity is to reveal these problems and to draw public attention to them. They are eager to deliver their position and express themselves through art. 
However, they often face censorship. Even in the age of Ekaterina the Great it was forbidden to write about the issues those contradict the policy of the monarch. Ekaterina ordered to burn all the the book "The travelling from St. Petersburg to Moscow", which depicted the poor life of the peasants. Censorship exanded in the Soviet Union, a lot of information was hidden from the citizens of our country. Even when the Chernobil accident happened not all the inhabitats of Pripyat were informed and evacuated, so it can lead to terrible consequences. 
These examples show that a freedom of speech and a freedom to express your ideas are of essential importance. I strongly believe that the government should avoid approving any bills that can restrict people say what they want. Any bill passed for the sake of creating phrames and bourders for journalists, artists, musicians doesn't bring a benefit to the society. Evidently, these measures are aimed at contributing to the strength of the authorities only. The fact is that the restrictions haven't ever been objective. All the views should be expressed, everyone has a right to be heard, and the public is to decide wheather to agree with a person and his opinion or not; not the government should make a decision. 
All things considered, I am sure that censorship brings disadvantages to the society only and all the possible views should be presented to the public.
