Nowadays modern people have a lot of health problems caused by stress, pollution, junk food like depression, obesity and so on. In this case some people say that the sport opportunities should be rised to solve this problems. However, another group of people supportes the view that this actions would not be very effective. On the one hand, improving the number of sport facilities will influence on public health because a lot of problems could been solved if people change their lifestyle to better one, because the one problem is caused by another one. For example, we can improve immunitet and lose weight by practicing simple exercises, dancing or going to jim, but if we don't pay enough attention for this problem they cause more serious deseases like insult. In this case increase in number of sports facilities can be very useful thus people will have good and significant opportunity for changing their lifestyle. As for me, I prefer to go to the stadion and play basketball with friends instead of expansive lessons in fitness clubs. On the other hand, if society want to solve health problems and improve public health it should take some complex actions because a lot of troubles are effect of air, water pollution, carbon dioxide emissions, stresses and junk food. Society should provide healthy lifestyle and influence on people's vision of life to improve public health in general so there is no doubt that rising the number of sports facilities is not enough for it. To sum up, I want to say that I am strongly believe that society can reach some unimaginable goals in improving public health by providing healthy lifestyle and using all opportunities properly.
