Nowadays the problem of live experiences is one of the most controversial. What experience influence more on our person: with we are born or that we get during of all our life? 
First of all, it should be mentioned that characteristics that we have from our born are researched not in all. But a lot of scientist say that we all born with a different abilities, that's why we haven't equal opportunity to develop. For example there are a lot of researches indicate that people who was born in Asia or in Europe have more abilities than those, who was born in Africa (it's not some racist argument). Also, our "natural" experience such as DNA for example is an important part of our development. It's a DNA, that influence on our body, our communicative skills, potential of development, and certain other skills. That's why it can be sayed that DNA form our personality. But there is another point of view that also can exist, because life experience it's an important part of our personality. Our society create us, and it's true. Because our behavior depend of people, that cover us. 
To sum up, I can mention that both this points of way can exist and it's very hard to find same diferent between "natural" ex perience and live experience. But, it's obviously that characteristics we are born with influence more on our persone because they create the base of our personality and development.
