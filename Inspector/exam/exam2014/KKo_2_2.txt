It goes without saying that the public health is very important for the well-being of the country, because nowadays every nation tries to be the most successful and powerful. Unfortunately, modern people haven't perfect health and the society wants to know how to improve it. 
Some people think that the health is directly connected with the sport and the best way to make people healthier is to give them more opportunities to do sports. They offer different ways to make people closer to physical activities, for example to increase the number of sports classes in schools and universities, to make some gyms free and to create special sports objects for children and adults. Supporters of this point of view consider sport as the main measure for public health. 
However, there are people who say that it is not enough to make public health better. Firstly, many diseases are not treated by sports, moreover, some of them ban physical activity. Secondly, nowadays the world face with the more serious problems as drug or alcohol addiction, which is more popular than laziness and absence of sports in people's life. To make people healthier it is necessary to make our world better in such way as environment. Many people suffer from bad ecology and pollution of the environment is one of the reasons of many diseases. Moreover, it is very important to provide good quality of medical care and pharmacology, because in many countries these spheres have serious drawbacks. 
To conclude, I would like to say that if we really want to be healthy we should take care about our body ourselves, but of course with the help of the state, and the best way to do it is to use all ways which I have named above.
