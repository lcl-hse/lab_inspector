There is an opinion that creative people like artists, writers and so on should have the freedom to express their ideas in whichever way they may wish and governments should not barrier their activities. 
As for me, this point of view is absolutely wrong. First of all, if governments allow people who call themselves artists to express themselves in whichever may they like, that will provide an unstoppable chaos because than anyone just by proclaiming that he is an artist will have a liberty to do whatever he likes calling his actions an art. Furthermore, I believe that governments should provide order and order is only achieves by control. Governments which can't provide control may lose a respect of their citizens and, which is much worse, legitimacy. For example, last year one so called artist clipres his testicles to the ground at the Red square as an act of protest against Russian government. As for me, I doubt that this is an acceptable way of self-expression. 
There is an another argument: providing such freedom to artists conpredicts the basic principles of the democracy. According to the liberal position, no group should have preferences in their social rights, everybody must be equal, no mater who those people are: buisinessmen, labors or artists. If society gives preferences to some group they means that this group may avoid rules which influences freedom. 
In conclusion, I'd live to state one more time that artists should not be out of restrictions on what they do because it is immoral and unfair to other social groups and also because this may put society in a dangerous situation.
