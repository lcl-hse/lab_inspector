In modern world, there are a lot of discussions about role of sports in people's health and whether or not should we invest in building more sports facilities or focus more on other factors affecting public health. Some people say that sports and physical education are the ultimate way to improve nation's health, other believe there are more important things. So, will building sports facilities have desired effect on health? 
Firstly, obviosly, our health does depend on our lifestyle. It depends on whether or not we go for a morning jog, or how many times a week do we exercise. And in big cities it is difficult to find time to go to the gym, especially if it is on the other side of the town. So, if we build more gyms, stadiums and strategically locate them in the most convenient places, more people will spend time on improving their bodies and keeping themselves fit. It will have a positive effect on their health and may inspire others to do the same. 
But, if we look from another perspective, it is obvious that we have to spend a lot of money on facilities without getting immediate result. And it might be a better short-term decision to spend more money on other programs, such as healthy eating or medical care. 
Public health is very important. And, of course, we have to invest in it. But, in my opinion, while sports is one of the main health factors, it is not the only one, so we shouldn't focus on only one task, but distribute financing evenly between several measures.
