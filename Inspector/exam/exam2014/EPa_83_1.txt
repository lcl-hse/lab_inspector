The pie charts given illustrate the current situation of the ages of the citizens in 2000 and the predictions for 2050 in two different countries. 
As we can see, in Yemen the percentage of children and teenagers (aged 0-14 years) will be lower in 2050 then in 2000. However, the number of adults and old people will increase for 50 years by 11 percent. 
In 2000 in Italy one forth of the population was in age of 60+ and, according to this court, this amount will almost double by 2050. As in Yemen, the number of children will fall in Italy but not as sharply as in the first country. The amount of adults will decrease by about 15 percent to 2050. 
The charts show that the tendencies of the 0-14 and 60+ years age groups are alike in two given countries. But in 15-59 years age group there is a difference: while in Yemen this percentage is likely to rise, in Italy this amount by 2050 will be lower.
