These charts below show population differents between Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050. So, now I will give some description. 
Let's have a look on graphes, which show present population in Yemen and Italy. There are three different groups: (0-14 years), (15-59 years) and (60+ years). In Yemen more than 50% are (0-14 years old) and only 14,3% in Italy. As we can see, in Yemen there is a little percent of old people, as in Italy it is 24,1%. 
Now I want to write some words about projections graphs. As we can see, there is decrease of young people. In Italy we can see that the percent of two groups: (0-14) and (15-59) will down, but the number of (60+) will raise. In Yemen only the percent of one group: (0-14) will fall and the percent of (60+) and (15-59) will raise, but these percents will not very big. 
In conclusion I want to say that government will try to raise up the percent of young population, help families with money, but the graph (population) will increase if only people want it.
