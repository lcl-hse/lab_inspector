Unfortunately nowadays the conditions of the public health leaves much to be desired. According to this hot-potato problems effective measures need to be handed urgently up. There is a disputable paint of view that for public health improvement the number of sport facilities should be significantly increased. So, the question remains relevant: "To what extent such measure could be effective?" On the one hand, undoubtedly sport improves the health, consequently, well-spread sport facilities seem to make people more interested in a healthy diet, they will try to go to the gym systematically improving their train results. If the sport facilities are supported by appropriate advertising, it is highly likely that more people will decide to improve their health by buying an abonement. It seems important to point out that sport involment supposes the systematic and rational healthy diet. That is why during your train-period you are really becoming healthier. Moreover, it is obviously that the general level of public health depends on the percentage of the people who involved in sport regardless whether they are professionals or not. On the other hand, the main argument used against this point of view is that only few people will be able to spend enough money to go to the highly-costed gym. The introduction of the number of sport facilities requires a significant support. To my way of thinking, the increasement of the number of sport facilities will definitely improve public health. To understand this underlying concept properly you should go to the gym, at least once. If you follow this advice, you will definitely never think whether sport improves health or not. Obviously, there is only one exact answer: "Yes, it does"
