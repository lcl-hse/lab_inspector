In modern world new technological developments and the science progress can lead to environmental problems, because people should care about their health. I believe that many measures can improve public health. 
Some people consider that only the growth of number of sports facilities can give a positive effect in the problem of health. Human beings. Should go to various sport clubs and fitness gyms, because it doesn't afford them to suffer from the obesity and other diseases. Also the body will be fit and strong, therefore the population will feel itself better. In Germany, for example, people say the mention 'sport treiben - Gesund bleiben'. It means that a man, who does the sport, will always have a excellent health. 
Moreover, other part of people think that only sport but also the food, thoughts of people and their job can influence the health. The fast-moving world pressure on people, therefore they have no time to eat healthy food, vegetables and fruit. So they start to eat fast food, junk food, (for instance, french fries, coca-cola and other soft drinks, burgers etc. ). It leads to different diseases and damages the health. Moreover, people cannot relax, because their jobs bring them nervous things. And human beings are too busy to spent time even with their family. And, of course, they cannot spent time to go to the gym. Furthermore, negative thoughts and emotions give the worst results. If people think in a positive way, they will have a good health. And scientists argue that it is right. I consider that all facts can influence a public health, therefore people should care about all aspects of their life. 
In conclusion, each person should take into account the fact that his life depends on his health. Consequently, in my opinion, many measures can help to live without diseases and problems with health.
