The problem of improving health among people has been discussed a lot lately. Indeed, there are different aspects of this issue and, as a result, different opinions on it. Some people think that increasing the number of sport facilities is one of the best way to increase the level of human health. Others contradict it. 
People are ought to think that sport is the best way to keep fit and improve health. And they have some arguments which support their point of view. First of all, when you do sports, your body starts work. As we know, movement is the key for a good health. Moreover, sport teaches you discipline and this is also good for you. 
Also there are people who think that there are a great variety of mesures, which can be useful for soluting this problem. And they have some reasons for this opinion. First of all, the improvement of medical service can absolutely increase the average level of human health. Moreover, the government shoul control the level of air poluting, which has a great influence on human health. Though we should respect other people's opinion, I cannot agree with this point of view. I think that doing sports regulary causes a good health. 
In conclusion, I would like to underline that in my opinion every person has his own priorities in this issue and so has a right to decide what suits him better. But I think that the arguments for not doing sports for health are invalid.
