The charts that are presented in the task illustrate changes on the ages of the populations of Italy and Yemen in 2000. Also they show predictions for the year 2050. 
Speaking about initial trends in population in Italy and Yemen in 2000 it should be noticed that the main difference could be seen in numbers of people aged 60+ years which are 20% more presented in Italy. Another interesting comparison that should be highlighted is that half of Yemen population consists of citizens aged between 0 and 14 years while in Italy they take only 15%. 
Summing it up, all the data presented predicts better future by the year 2050 for Yemen where the most hard-working part of population (aged 15-59 years) will take almost 60%. In comparison these numbers decrease in Italy to 42.3% with the significant enlargement of elderly (60+ years) population.
