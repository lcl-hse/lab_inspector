The chart below showd demographic situation in two countries. The diagrams on the left give statistical data about population in Yemen and Italy and two diagrams on the right reflect some predictions on future. Firstly I'll describe the diagrams on the left. In Yemen in 2000 half of population consisted of people aged from 0 to 14 years, while in Italy on 14,3 percent of population aged 0 to 14. In Italy 61,6% people aged from 15-59 years. Comparing with Yemen, the difference is not dramatical, 46,3 percent. There is a big difference between two countries in the percentage of people who are older than 60: 24,1% in Italy versus 3,6% in Yemen. Now I'll cover the projection for the 2050. The gap between 0-14 year olders expected to shrink: in Yemen this demographical group constructs 37% and in Italy - 11,5%. The percentage of people who are 60+ is expected to double and reach 42,3% in Italy. While in Yemen this numbers stay almost the same
