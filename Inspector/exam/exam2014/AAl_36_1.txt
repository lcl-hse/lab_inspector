The graph presents the situation with the population aged 65 and over in Japan, Sweden and USA between 1940 and 2040. It should be noticed that Japan has only 5% of people of this group at the begining of 1940. But after that the statistics decreased to the point of 4% (the lowest number) in 1960. And after that it had not almost any changes till 2000. The quantity of population aged 65 and over will increase dramatically in the future in this country. It is really interesting that two different countries like USA and Sweden have almost the same statistics. The graph shows that the number of people of 65 and over age group at 1940 was only about 78%. And during the whole period of time it had a slightly increase till the point of 15% in 1980. After that the proportion changed on 5% (20% for Sweden and 15% for USA). At 2040 all countries will have almost the same proportion (about 25%).
