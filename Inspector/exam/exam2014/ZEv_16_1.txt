The first chart shows how much people travelled to and from the UK during the period from 1979 to 1999. The second chart gives data about countries that were most popular among UK residents in 1999. 
On the first chart we can obviously see that the number of people travelling to and from the UK increased greatly. The number of UK residents visiting abroad raided from about 10 percent to more than 50 percent in the period of 20 year. At the same time, the number of overseas residents increased to about 25 percent, that is less than the figure for UK residents but still noticable. 
We can see that UK residence have a tendency to visit European countries - France and Spain - more than other countries. France is the most popular with more than 10 millions of UK visitors in 1999 and Spain tooks the second place with pretty less than 10 millions. USA,Greece and Turkey are less popular with only about 2,5 - 3,5 millions of UK tourists.
