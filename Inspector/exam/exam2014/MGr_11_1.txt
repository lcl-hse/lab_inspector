The following graph and chart show us statistics features connected with using the electricity in England. In another words, both of them provide us with the figures of typical daily demand for electricity and illustrate for what purposes people used the electricity. 
It is obvious, according to the first graph, that the greatest amount of units of electricity is used by people in winter. The figures of consuming the electricity is about 40000. In order to prove this statistics it is necessary to look at the purposes of using the electricity. By the way, the pie chart shows us that nearly 52,5% is used for heating rooms and water which is more than a half of all electricity used by English people. As for the summer it is worth noticing that the amount of units of electricity is rather small (about 20000). It can be explained with the fact that people do not need too much electricity resources in summer. According to the pie chart another 47,5% of electricity is spread amog using ovens, kettles (17,5%), lighting, TV and radio (15%) and vaccuum cleaners, food mixers or electric tools as well. Moreover, another noticeable point is that the greatest figures of demanding the electricity are during 21 hrs-24 hrs period. However, it proves that at this time most of people are at home and do their activities such as watching TV, having dinner and so on. 
Overall, after summarising the information (statistics) we can state that healthy is above all at winter. It is the main priority for English people.
