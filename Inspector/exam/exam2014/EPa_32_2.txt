Nowadays public health has become worse than whatever before. Governments of many countries look for ways for improving it. Some people assume that it can be done by increasing the quantity of sports buildings, but other people are sure that it is not enough and we need to try finding other ways for becoming healthier. 
The main argument in favour is that if we will increase the number of sport buildings we will be able to provide our children with more opportunities to do sport. Sport always does children healthier than their classmates and friends who do not take sport. Moreover, people in ages of 25-60 years also can take part, not in professional, but in sport, which brings healthy state of a body. 
Apart from that, professional sport can bring injuries to those who train a lot at the same time with becoming healthier. For this reason we should understand which kind of sport and which quantity of sport makes people healthier. Moreover, people who never do sport in their lives will not become much healthier than before if they start in age of 40-50. Instead of health improving governments will get becoming it more worse. I believe that it is impossible to improve public health only by increasing sport facilities, because there are a lot of things, which people health depends on: environmental conditions, the weather and so on. In this case governments should, for example, improve air atmosphere for achieving the aim. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress that people health needs improving nowadays, but to develop only one side is not enough. We should consider all aspects, which can be useful, to succeed in achieving the population health becomes better.
