There are a lot of views about may whether artists express their emotions in their work, for example, pictures, music or films or not. I guess that talanted people should be given the freedom to express their own ideas, but it must limited by law! 
There are a lot of people who are very talanted and have already been Masters in their field. Especially, these days the areas which have very big audience, such as picture, music, film and etc, are developing significantly. However, it does not mean that they can express their ideas freely. Of course, there should be imposed limits of government in their activities. Without restriction there may be some problems, since some art works contain the ideas which are not suitable for children and government's laws. 
To sum up. I think the ideas of the artists must be limited by law.
