Nowadays, some people suppose that it need to improve public health with help of increasing the number of sports facilities. Nevertheless, others say that it is bad solution of problem and it is necessary to use other measurers. I am sure that increasing the number of sports facilities is the best solution of problem. First of all, sport is very important for our health. People which practise sports have a strong immunity system, they do not suffer from diseases and they have a perfect body with big muscules. So, doing sport is the very big advantage for public health. However, some say that increasing the number of sports facilities is bad idea because there are lot of other measures to improve public health. It can be limited amount of junk food restaurant in the city. People will not go to the McDonald's and other restaurants and so their health will be better. Another way to improve public health is making the price of medicaments and antibiotics more low. So medicaments will become more available for poor ill people. Nevertheless, I suppose that if the government will build a lot of sports gym with swimming pools, table tennis, baskets, fields for golf and so on, people will visit gyms with pleasure a lot of times. As a result public health will become more strong and better. In conclusion, it is need to say that the health is very important thing for all. The health for man is his richness. So it is necessary to improve public health with help of all available ways, especially, with help of sport.
