The table have three graphs of differences between countries of amount of people not younger than 65 years old. These three countries are USA, Sweden and Japan. We have statistics by years from 1940 till our time and the prediction until 2040 (one hundred years in general). 
As we can see every country has a tendention the population becomes older. In 1940 the percent of old people was between 5 and 10, but in 2040 is about 25 percent in every country expecting. However, when graphs of Sweden and USA are approximately equal and show permanent permanent decrease of quantity of old people, Japan's graph is more interesting. In the period between 1940 and our time proportion indicates a stability on 5 percent. But then, according to the forecast, percentage is going to have a tremendous jump and Japan becomes the most old country be population out of these three ( percent is more than 25).
