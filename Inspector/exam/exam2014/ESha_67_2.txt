In 21th century our society is confronted with an aim to improve public health. The solution was found in increasing the number of some sports facilities. And my opinion is that it is the right way to care about health of citizen. 
First of all, it is important for people to have hobby, so sport is a good thing to do in your free time. If there are some sport facilities, it is easy to find something yours. So, I think the goverbnet has to make some sport activities, what will improve public health. For example, muss runnig in the center of the city. It is not only good for health, but also help people to communicate with each other. 
The second point I want to talk, is sport facilities in schools. It is important for children from young years have a healthy lifestyle. So football, basketball, volleyball and so on activities in school after subjects are very necessary for childrens future and their health. 
But there are other opinion, that increasing the number of sport facilities would have just a little effect on public health. It is thought that oter measures are more required. I can agree with that statement, because these arrangements are not enough for improving public health, but it is still important to pay peoples attention at sport and, as result, at their own health. 
To sum up, I want to add, that the health of nations is our important goal. And in every country government has to increase public health it could be not only sport facilities, but also health centers or something else. All the world has to assume measures to improve public health.
