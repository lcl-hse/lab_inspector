There are some countries, for example, UK or USA, where people who have gratuated high school can take a year before starting university studies. Dureing this year usually they work or travel around the world. but so, what advantages or disadvantages are there of it. 
Of course, pross of this time break is accident. First of all, many young people who have just left school cannot choose what kind of profession is more suitable for them. During this year between school and university they can try themselves everywhere and understand what they want. It is and exellent chance to get a rich work experience. Moreover, many young people take this pause for travelling. This is also good opportunity, but not work, by contrast- life experience. It is enough important for their future adults life. 
On the other hand, in many countries, for exmaple in Russia, to take time break between school and university is not tradition. Why? Maybe, there are some disadvantages of this pause. Young people wnat to get higher education as more faster as possible, because some employers prefer to support young specialists. Moreover,k many teenagers during the year of pause usually lose any ability to study and they may no want to return to educational process and they risk to staywithout university's diplom. Also,boys who do not come ti university will go away to arm. 
In conclusion, I want to say that of course every persom can have the right for his own opinion. But I think a year between finising school and starting university studies should be encouraged because young berson get a good chance to understand himself and to learn the world.
