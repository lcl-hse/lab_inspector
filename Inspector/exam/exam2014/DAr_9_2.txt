Nowadays it is extremely important to be healthy. The majority of people are sure that the amount of healthier residents will grow if there are available sport opportunities. Though, others think these facilities would not be the solution of this problem. They say there is a necessity of providing people with other measures. On the one hand, it is a great idea if government invests money in improving public health. First of all, today sport becomes an essential part of people's life. Teenagers and adults seek to look beautiful and they want to position themselves as people who lead the healthy way of life. That is why the growing number of sports facilities facilitates an increasing number of those who are interested in keeping a good shape. Besides, if the inhabitants of the particular country have the opportunity to improve their health conditions without wasting time, they will definitely thake the chance to do it. On the other hand, others opinion is that government activities would have little effect on health of population. People who are not well aware of possible sports facilities would stay home and do nothing for the public improvement. What is more, this policy would be useless in case of expensive prices for visiting a gym, for example, or in case of long distancy from home to sport center. In my opinion, the best way to rise the level of healthy people is certainly to provide residents with the wide range of sports opportunities. If there are more gyms near people's home and cheap costs for visiting them, all people will desire being active participants in improving their health. All in all, it is worth trying to increase the number of sports facilities. Time will show what is necessary to change in a better way if previous measures do not benefit.
