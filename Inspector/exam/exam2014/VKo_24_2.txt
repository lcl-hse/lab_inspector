Nowadays, there are many heated debates about whether government restrictions should exist and control what creative artists are allowed to do or whether we should give freedom to those artists to express in a way they want. Personally, I absolutely agree with the first point of view due to some reasons. 
First of all, to my mind, it is absolutely important to control every sphere of our life, if it is not under a certain amount of control, there would be a disaster. Consequently, by giving the freedom to creative artists to express themselves as they want will definitely lead to certain problems. For instance, it would be almost impossible to keep an eye on a censure, because some artists have got an extraordinary views on art. 
Secondly, many unofficial films, pictures etc. will appear. Hence, it would be veryhard to control this big flow of pirate movies, not officially recorded songs. Therefore, it will lead to more people who break the rules and the rate of crime will grow. 
On the other hand, many people may say that we have to think about the freedom of expression. While speaking about this theme. Although this opinion makes sense, little to these people realize how many disadvantages will appear when government restrictions are off. 
To reteirate my point of view, I do believe that everything in this world should be under the control of something whether it is government or parents, because without restrictions we will not be able to live a sedate life.
