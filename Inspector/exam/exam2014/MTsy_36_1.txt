On the given charts where there is a statistic on the number of people in different age groups in Italy and Yemen. 
The first thing which is possible to find out from the diagrams is that the number of children under 14 years old in Yemen is about a half of the whole population, but on the same time in Italy this persantage is about 3,5 times lower. The main age group in Italy in 2000, according to the statistics is 15-59 years old. In Yemen it is also big enough, moving to the half and is about 46,3%, but this percentage is not more then two thinds from the Italy's stats. This obviously means that the average Yemen family has more then one child, but in Italy it seems to be about 1 or even less. Another key point shows us that the elder generation of Italians, which is 60 years and older, takes a bit less then one-fourth of the population, meanwhile in Yemen it is not more then 3,6%. 
However, what are the dinamics and trends in population structure in a long-term perspective? In 2050, the number of middle-ageg people is going to increase by 9%, due to the decrease of the number of children by 13% of the whole population. The number of 60+ age group is also increasing dramatically from 3.6% to 5,7% which is more then 50% growth. 
In Italy we can see similar dinamics in children's and 60+ population structure, but the number of middle aged will fall under 50% of the whole population. On the same time, the number of Italians older then 60 will rapidly raise to the 42.3%. 
Overall, we can see similar dinamics of population structurising between 2000 and 2050 for Italy and Yemen, but it is a good statistic for Yemen, helping to fight overpopulation, and bad for Italy facing the overaging of the population process.
