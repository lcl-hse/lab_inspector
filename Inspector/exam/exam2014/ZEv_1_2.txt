There are a lot of countries where schools' pupils have problems with their behaviour. So, it can be caused by several reasons. And we should try to find a solution of this problem. 
On the one hand, one of the causes of such students' behaviour is considered to be their age period. So, the time in school is very difficult for pupils, because it is the period of the foundation of their personality. That's why, teenagers often do some impulsive things or smth like these. What is more, sometimes if teenagers do not know what to do in certan situation, they are able to make bad things. However, it doesn't means that they wanted to do or say smth like they did. 
Of course there are a lot of other causes why pupils have problems with their behaviour. Nevertheless, when teachers communicate with such teenagers they should always remember about the specify of the teenager's behaviour. Moreover, older people are able to try to be more kind with students. However, they should always make a lealance between kind behaviour and strickt behaviour. In addition, it seems to be a good idea to organise some collectives in shooles where teenagers can go and communicate with each other, where they are able to do smt together or to tell smb about their problems. Thank's to such collective students can avoid stees, conseguantely, the will be more kind. 
All in all, we should always remember that for some students the school period is a really difficult period. That's why people should try to communicate with teenagers and to help them with the foundation of teenagers' personallity.
