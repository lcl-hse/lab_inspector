Nowadays there is very actual opinion that schools should do some unpaid work as lessons to teach students how to help other people. I agree with it and think that such school programmes are necessary. 
Firstly, it teaches children how to communicate in the community and give their experiense to the classmates or needed persons. You can help with some things or make some program which must help to achieve points. 
Secondly, students can see a problems of other people, their mistakes and try not to repeat it in the future. Maybe it helps them to choose a right way, because children can think about problems that usually solve elder people. 
Finally, unpaid community services help government to save the money. If many schools will have such lessons a lot of work will done by children. In my opinion there is no anything harm for school children if they pass time in working for a charity or improving houses or any another work. 
In conclusion I think the idea of making unpaid lessons is very good for community because it helps it to be better.
