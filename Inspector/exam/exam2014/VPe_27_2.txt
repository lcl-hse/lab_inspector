Currently, it is rather widespread that after finishing school teenagers take a gap year to work or travel before enrolling in a university. Moreover, I believe that it is, or reasonable to enter university rightaway after one has finished school. 
The first reason for this is that in this case the person's knowledge are fresh which allows him or her to feel more confident while getting further education and to make the process of studying smoother. Secondly, after school we are accustomed to learn much and our memory is active which contributes to bring more and more at easy with studies. If a person takes a tear off, he may them find it difficult to get down to books and reveal that because of not training his brain properly his ability to concentrate and memorise has weakened. Furthermore, after a gap year one can simply lose his motivation and desire to study which may well result in his not getting a university diploma at all. It is exactly the case with my friend, who relaxed after a working year and postponed further education for an unknown period. 
However, it cannot be denied that during the gap year a person can get valuable working experience which will make it easier to find a position in the future. In addition, taking into account the stress which accompanied taking school exams, a year before university may have a beneficial effect on teenagers mental and physical health, allowing them to recharge their energy. This will probably stand them in good stead. 
To conclude, although both points of view make sense, personally I think that it is more beneficial for young people to go int higher education right after their school.
