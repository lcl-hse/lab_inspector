The given provides us with information about underground systems in London, Paris, Washington DC, Koyoto and Los Angeles. 
Overall, most of the systems were built in XX century, except for London subways (opened in 1863) and LA (opened in 2001). 
Although, there are some other points. For example, the latest underground system being opened in 2001 in LA has more nearly twice and a half longer route comparing with the Koyoto system ( 28 in LA and 11 km in Koyoto). The biggest amount of passengers in 1927 million people per year use Tokyo system, which is just 155 kilometres long. On the countorary the London Underground is way longer (394), but was a much lower amount of those, who use subway as a mean of transport. Furthermore, twice shorter lines of Paris system (comparing to the London one) earlier transfers more passengers - 1191 million. The shortest above all Koyoto railway which goes under ground and has only 45 million of passengers during 1 year.
