In our rapidly changing world the problem of artist's selfrealisation is burning question. There is argument between people who think it is important to give artists freedom and right to choose their form of presentation their art by their own; others say the society needs government restriction to control that. I complietly support the idea of freedom for artists and have to present some extend supporting my point of view. 
Firstly, I do believe that artist can give the world some new way of presentation of art pieces. For example, serbian artist Marina Abramovich set a new type of contemporary art called "performance". 
Moreover, some frames can cause negative results of artist's psychological health and stability. It is widely famous that many of them try drugs or even can make a successful attempt of suiside. 
However, some people are sure the government needs to control artists. They usually use the case of Pussy Riot (russian punk band) as an example of breaking law during the performance. As I see that it was a political campaign and there were no governmental restrict about the art, but about the position. After people say that artist can make the society unstable and as the example use russian artist called Petr Pavlensky. I disagree because my point of view is that we cannot be provoced by some of them without several reasons and the core of the problem is not about art, but general society. 
To sum up, I complietly agree that if we give artists a [] to do what they want they can reach our culture, create something new and get a fame all over the world for them and their own country, family and nationality.
