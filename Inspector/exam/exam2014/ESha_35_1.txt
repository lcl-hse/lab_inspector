The pie charts presented for analysis describe population statistics in countries of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and forecast for the year 2050. 
To begin with, the main characteristics of the countries at the start of the period are that Yemen's population is mostly divided between children up to 14 years and grown-ups under the age of 60, with a slight prevailance of youngsters and almost unconsiderable amount of elderly with 3,6%, while Italy has almost two thirds of it population (61,6%) in the working age gap and about a quarter (24,1%) of the nation is over 60 years in age, leaving 14,3% for children, as opposed to 50,1% in Yemen. 
However, tendencies of population division differ between the countries. As predicted by scientists, both countries will see increases in elderly population percentages (arise by 2,1% and 18,2% for Yemen and Italy respectively) but meanwhile the population of Yemen is going to consist mostly of grown-ups with 57,3% while the same year gap in Italy would decrease from 61,6% to 46,2%, although remaining the biggest part of population. At the same time, both populations are projected to consist less of citizens under 14 years. 
To make a conclusion, both nature of social division and the dynamics of its alterations in Italy and Yemen are diverse.
