There are different ways to express emotions or show your ideas to the world. It can be music or dance performance, drawing pictures or it can be even simple words which show your feelings. During centures people learnt to express themselves somehow and present days are not an exception. 
Some people think that it is illegal to do what person wants and where he wants, because there are some laws and moral rules which should stop people doing strange things on the public. The aim of performers is to attract the audience attention and sometimes they break all rules and do amoral things, which can shock other people. The main solution of such problem is government restrictions. Only when people are afraid of doing crazy things they will not do it. 
On the other hand there is another opinion. Some people think that people should be allowed to express themselves because all people have freedom and can do everything to say something to the world, but it depends on the way they show their thoughts and feelings. There are different beautiful things people can do to make this world brighter. For example street art or street music, it is always followed by positive reaction, makes people's mood better. If noone express themselves we will never know about creative and talanted artists, singers, musicians, writers, actors. The world then will be boring and grey. 
From my opinion people should express their emotions but they must notice the borders and know the main rules, especially moral rules. Because sometimes people do strange creepy things which shocked publicity. 
Generally speaking, government should make some rules for people who want to be noticed by doing creative things, only then there will not be different awfull accidents.
