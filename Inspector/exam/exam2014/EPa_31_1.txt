The presented charts are giving us the statistical information about the population of Yemen and Italy, dividing it on sectors by the age. The information given is describing the situation current for the year of 2000 and predicting it to 2050. 
The first feature we should pay attention on is the gap between the amount of kids younger than 14 in these countries. Besides the possibility that this number will become smaller in both countries in next fifty years, the gap will remain but also diminue. 
Also, both countries will probably rise their average maximal age, as it can be seen in the prediction on charts. The amount of old people will grow almost two times by 2050th. 
Those tho thrends can change the economical situation in both states. But if Yemen labour market will grow because of increasing of people fifteen to sixty years old, the situation in Italy is completely opposite because the amount of retired people is already significantly bigger and tend to grow.
