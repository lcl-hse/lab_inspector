Nowadays more and more young people are becoming interested in working or travelling for a year before studying at the university some of them believe that it is an unsuitable decision for them. So, what is better: to work some time or to study at University straightaway? 
On the one hand, the benefits of the first point of view cannot be denied. Firstly, it is a perfect opportunity to work for a year in order to think what do you want to be. For example, you can try yourself in different spheres and decide, what is more appropriate for you. Secondly, travelling for a year before university studies is suitable way for those who did not decide where he is going to work. For instance, if a person do not desire to work in his native town or country, he can travel a little bit and choose a place he wants. 
On the other hand, there are some drawbacks of nussing a year. First of all, people finished high school do not have enough skills to work before the university. So, their knowledge is pretty low and they are not able to understand what they want, Secondly, when this year between high school and university is over, the person can understand, that studying skills are already lost, that he is not able to continue education because of the fact that he just forgot how to do it. 
In conclusion, I suppose that it is better to continue studies straightaway after finishing high school. Possibly, it is better not to change your workplace only because you do not have enough skills, may be it is better to change studyplace and in the end to find a place that is perfectly suitable for you.
