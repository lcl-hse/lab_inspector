The conversation about "liberty of word" are very popular today. We can see that all the world divide in two absolutely different positions. 
I will call them the "East" and the "West". The forms of government control are stronger in east countries like Islamic Republic. Meanwhile in high developped west democratic states some government restrictions do not exist. 
What about me I disagree the opinion presented in the topic. Of course the freedoom of "West" is much more better than the total control and religioys barriers of the "East". But I am sure that humanity isn't ready for an absolut liberty. The high level of life abd resolved problem of natural needs provoke an unbelievable increace of the number of different artists. Increace the amount but not quality. The information space is full by low-quality art. About 80% of actual art is unusable trash. But it isn't the worst! 
Is absolutely clear that in our society have place a lot of ilness people whose ideas are really dangerous. Of course every adult human can filter the information that he tooks. But what about children? And here we needs governmental control. The possability of express our own ideas is wonderfool but not all ideas have to be promoted into the public. Somebody have to express his ideas only in hospital alone and closed. 
But we mustn't forget that total form of government control like in Soviet Union are terrible. Who knows how many yoiung talents disapperd here. I confirm that the ootional variant is any middle line. Free state with a developed form of control in children's and political content. The stated based on ideas of liberty and respect. Express yourself, but respect other opinions.
