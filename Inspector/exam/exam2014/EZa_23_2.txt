It is generally believed that the only important goal for humanity is happiness. But different people have different meanings for happiness. I think that there is one min reason why it is so hard to define a word "happiness". I suppose that there are few factors that helps people to be happy. 
Firstly, I will try to suggest why happiness may have different meanings. Everyone wants to be happy but everyone understands it differently. To my mind, this problem occurs because there are so many countries and cultures in the world and every culture has its own understanding of happiness. For example I have a friend who thinks that the only way which leads to happiness is to be with God. He is very religious what is quite surprising for modern society. 
Me and my parent consider happiness as something what helps you to feel free: an education. Me and my friend was brought up in different cultures that is why we have different understanding of the world happiness. 
Secondly, I would mention some factors wich can help to achieve happiness. For instance, it is health, because if you are unhealthy the only thing you think of is how to stop pain. 
The second place goes to having healthy friends and relatives, because you always love them and wish them the best. And the third thing is wealthyness. Money is important because they help you to get education, broaden your mind by travelling and buy expensive medicals in some cases. 
In conclusion I would like to stress that happiness is something what is understood differently by people from different cultures. But there are some key factors that are always essential.
