The charts show some reasons for study according to age of students and the percentage of employers supporting them during the work. 
According to the first graph, there is an extreme difference among students under 26 and over 49 years old. As it is shown, the most part of students would work a lot in order to be absolutely content with the future career position. And only 10 per cent would choose a proffession connected with their interests. The next generation change their opinion, so people about 50 years and over do not follow career satisfaction, they are more likely to have exciting job. 
In the second chart the level of employer support is presented. Since the employee is under 26 years, he will get all the necessary conditions for working. According to the data, the older person is, the less support he gets. It may be connected with the fact that experienced people are more independent. However that does not mean that people over 49 are able to work themself. Almost 45% of employers would definitely support the staff, over 49 years old. 
In conclusion, it must be noticed that students who have no experience, but with the great career ambitions, are supported by the employer. And the eldery people who are into their career, also get the support, but the percentage is lower.
