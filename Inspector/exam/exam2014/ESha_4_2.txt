Nowadays in the world appears more and more people who think creative and express their ideas in different spheres. But the goverment restricts they activity. I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages in my essay. 
This opinion have several benefit. Firstly, creative artists do this world more colourful and others nice to see their creative products. For instance, the OBEY companies speciality on the street-art and we can see their picture in London and other city. Secondly, this people think new way in the art. And in each country have different artists who do new things which develop imagination of public. For example, in Norway live one man who did unusually animals from plastic. Furthermore this animals can walk on the beach thanks for windy. 
However this opinion have a drawbacks. And one of this disadvantages is wrong places which artists choose for their pictures. Some artists do their work on the wall of block of flats. A case of point is graffity. This art the goverment restricts. And next drawbacks is bad works of artists. Some creative people are mad and things which they do don't like the public because it may very crazy. For instance, the architector do his portret with his blood. It will not like othes. 
To conclude, the advantages outweight the disadvantages. Our world need in New art and people want see something new to do their life more different and leas boring.
