The problem of proportion between males and females in universities is very popular nowadays. There is a great deal of different opinions, but they all can be divided into two groups. Some people think that the equal numbers of men and women should be accepted by universities. Others consider that it is not essential. 
I completely disagree that equal numbers if male and female students should study in universities. 
First of all, it is evidently that males and females are interested and good in different subjects and areas. For example, men, as usual, are better than women in mathematics and technical subjects. On the other hand, females are better than males in literature and arts. Therefore, the rule of accepting equal numbers of male and female students would be harmful for all society, because a lot of good specialists in their fields would be lost for us. 
Secondly, if universities only accepted equal numbers of men and women, it would restrict rights and freedom of citizens. Nowadays rights and freedom of citizens is the main basis of every modern society. Consequently, we cannot ignore this aspect. 
However, a lot of people believe that it will be better if universities accept equal numbers of males and females, because a lot of scientists say that interaction between males and females is much for social and psyhological development of a person than interaction between only men or between only women. This position is very interesting, but I do not agree with it because interaction between males and females is possible not only during studying in universities, but also going in for sports, taking part in different events... Therefore, it is not essential for social and psyhological development to accept equal numbers of male and female students. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that equal numbers of males and females should not be accepted in every subject by universities.
