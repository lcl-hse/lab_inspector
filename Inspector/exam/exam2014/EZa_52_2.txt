Art wise people think that freedom of creative people is very important for their performance. However, government often try to put their facilities in frames. 
To begin with, I am completely agree with the opinions that creative people must notbe censored, moreover government should help them to success, making their live easier. Humanity knows a lot of very talented, unigue people who had lived in a poor conditions until they died, spending their life tyo struggle with routine problems like making living, find the place to live, they did a lot and became very popular and respectable after death. Gogol, Esenin, Bethowen are only a small part of them. More than 50% of scientists lived under pressure, but when Soviet Union started to help them, our country did some very reasonable discoveries and inventions. 
One of the most significant point of creative people's performance is their part in cultural development. Music, pictures, new means of thinking (theories), books increase the level of cultural valuence of country, history and make society smarter, all-rounded and creative. History knows some civilizations, which ignored "different" people, or even humilated and killed them. 
Everybody knows about Sparta. The government of this country was interested in only warriors, so they tackeled a lot of talented people from the mountain. The result is they successed in wars, but they was so culturaly poor, that vanished very fast. 
Thinking about the future, everybody must realise that creative, smart people is the engine of developement of the whole humanity. Government should to be gentle to them, allowing to performance whatever they want.
