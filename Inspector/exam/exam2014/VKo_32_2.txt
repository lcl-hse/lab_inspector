Each of us sometimes ask a question by yourself: is there limit in my freedom to express my personal beliefs and ideas? I strongly believe that define limits should exist, because we all live in the same world and should respect beliefs and ideas of different groups of people. I understand that this is a very contradictionary question, however I have my stable personal opinion on this issue and I want to illustare it by few examples. 
First of all, we should understand, that the way, how we express our opinion shouldn't hert anybody. Government should define the limits of our freedom to expression, and I think, that this is the main goal of government. Of course our government should represent all points of view on all problems, which exist in our society, and for this reason government can define the limits of our expression. 
On the other hand, huge amount of people believe, that creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own opinion, because it is art, and art have no limits, I can understand this people.
