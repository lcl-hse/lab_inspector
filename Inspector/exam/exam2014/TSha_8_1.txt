The graph indicates the comparison of 65 years old population and over in three countries like Japan, Sweden and USA. The X axis illustrates the percentage of researched population, the Y axis shows the year when the data was got. 
If we look to the graph it is can be clearly seen that the proportion of population aged 65 and over was higher in USA than in other countries from 1940 to 1980. When the data of the USA and Sweden was growing up to 15%, the 65 years old population in Japan was levelling out to 3% and stayed approximately the same from 1960 to 1990. After this point it is seen the growth of elder people's percentage in three countries. Sweden reached a peak in 2010 and was at 20%. However the USA's data was climbing up steadily. It is can be also said that Japan's population will rise dramatically from 10% to 25% in 2030. 
To sum up, the proportion of population aged 65 and over is rising during the last four decades in 2040 Japan will have the most one.
