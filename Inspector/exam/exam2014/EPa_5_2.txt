No doubt, with development science and technology our word have fast rhythm of life. So people forget about care about their health. They go to the work and don't eat in right way, as a consequences they have some problems with health. Some people believe that if we increase the number of sport facilities, we will improve public health. 
I rather agree than disagree with this point of view. Because, sport helps to keep fit and also develop fusical abilities. For example, while you running we breath oxigen that helps your body don't have serious problem with heart. Besides, nowadays it is common to use bycicles. It is a kind of sport, which helps your feet. It is also traffic solution. Because people use car less and we breath a fresh air. Furthermore, almost in every hostel there is sport club, where you can meet with new people. As a result you will have a good mood and do not have serious problems with your mind. 
As I concerned, sport improve our health, however, we don't have to remember about some negative effects. Firstly there are people who nave serious problem with health, e.g. vision lossing or breaking feet. These people cannot doing some kind of sports. So, they have to eat some fruits and some medicaments to improve their health, I suppose that fresh food is also an exellent method to get a good health. Secondly, some people work too hard in sport clubs. As a result they can have a serious problems with body. So, I think I prove that sport have not little effect on public health, there are negative or only positive effect. In conclussion I'd like to say that, sure sport is important part in our life, but it is decide to everyone use or not sport in real life. But we should not forget about other method, which can care about our health.
