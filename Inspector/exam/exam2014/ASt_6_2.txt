In all centuries artist are very creative. They also have a lot of unique ideas and use them to create pictures, music, films and others forms of art. Some people think that artists should express ideas in any way they want. But others regard that there must be some rules for artists to follow. 
It is well known that picture for painter is the best way to show his own thoughts and his soul. And some artists really want to create big pictures using houses' walls sometimes it looks really unusual but government have to give them this opportunity because only this way painters will be able to create true art. Also there are a lot of new ways to create something new. For example, recently artists started to use lazers to present their works. In fact it led to a great countribution to lazers' industry and country development. So the opportunity to express artists' ideas in way they want can help other areas to develop. As a matter of fact if a person does what he or she really want to individ will live longer. Because they will be much happier. Thus permission to express ideas in any way creators wish will make their life better. As a result more and more people will feel good due to many reasons. Because happiness has a tendency to spread around individs. 
But some bad things are likely to happen if government will give freedom to artists. It is possible that they will create not true but false art because they will be unable to stop themselves. Sometimes art can spoil peoples lifes. For example strange sculptures and pictures on walls of houses which public does not like. Because of that persons will have bad mood and live not as long as they have to. 
To same up there are different opinions about artists' freedom to express their ideas. But i think that there must be same government restrictions to predict troubles and prevent them.
