The statistics shows that happy people have much longer and brighter life than lonely and angry people. There are different factors to achieve happiness but it is not a secret that it is difficult to define it. The most important factors are good health, family and friends, and hobbies, which discussed below. 
In my opinion, the key point to happy life is good health. If you gain it, you have strength to realise your plans and reach the aims. For example, when I broke my leg in last autumn it was very difficult for me to continue the process of education and do the sport. Another reason for happiness is family and friends. To illustrate this, it is very important to have a help-hand in hard and difficult times. Thus, your parents can give you an advice and your friends could be a great for leasure activities and funny time. 
However, it's very difficult to find your individual hobby and it takes lots of ime to find a good friend. Si, it's not a simple to define happiness. Nevertheless, some people think that the way to happy life is only money and expensive leasure time. 
In conclusion, I would argue that modern society make our happiness by money and fame. However there are more important things such as your family, people around you, God and your favourite activities which can make your life more funny and happy than a sum of dollars.
