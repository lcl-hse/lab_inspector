Nowadays problem of health of all people is really cuasual. There are lots of different ways of solving this problem, one of the most popular is making people more interested in sport, by means of investing in different public sport facilities. 
According to some people, this way of solving health problem is really efficient. It brings great opportunities for young children who could train for free, it could make people think about spending their free time at stadiums. Doing sports can also make them think about the quality of the food they consume, becouse to reach some success in sports, they should be sure to eat only healthy one. To my mind, this sound reasonable. Providing sport facilities could be really helpful for whole the nation, just becouse people will have some alternatives for spending their lasure time. Inspite of watching TV, they can go and play football. I think that there could be no accounting about the fact that sport is good for health : it makes people move, it makes them interested in something. 
But, there is another view on the moment of how efficient providing sport facilities is. Some people are deeply convinced, that nobody or a very small percantage of people will change their life in a more helthear way becouse of government's investments in building public places for training... I'm not really sure, that this position has some serious reasons to exist, and it would be strange if investments in such sphere could not make any substantial effect. 
To conclude, there are two main opinions for the point of the effectiveness of increasing the amount of sport facilities, but I'm convinced that it could be really helpful for society.
