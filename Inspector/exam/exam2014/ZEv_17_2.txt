In many countries schools have some problems with behaviour of their student. I think it is happend because children have got much freedom than it was in the past. 
In my point of view, nowadays we have TV, the Internet and sometimes it have negative affect on studens. They get a lot of not only positive and usefull information but, of course, they get from TV something that change their mind to wrong, bad way. I have two sisters and everyday I see what are they watching on TV or in the Internet. Sometimes it is something interesting but most of all it is stupid and bad-influence things. My sistars ofther try to repeat what they have watched or imaginate something similar. It influence on they mind and than teacher at the school say my mother that my sisters have really horrible behaviour. Generally, media, TV and the Internet are really bad thing for childrens' mind. 
So, what we can do with this problem? I understand that technology are improved everyday and we cannot do anything. But we can organisate student activity: we should go for a walk, read bookes. We should help our children to improve their "branes", "minds". We must show them how "s good man" like, teach them and their behavior will be good because children understand, why they should do this kind of thing and never do another. 
To sum up, students and children do not have bad behavior from their birth, we can change them to be kind, good and help them to learn right things. Everything in our hands!
