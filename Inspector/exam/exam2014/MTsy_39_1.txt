There are some differents of demographical picture between Yemen and Italy in 2000 and 2050 years. 
The half of people of Yemen were the children before 14 years old. Almost the same amount of people of the country were adults from 15 rill 59 years old and only the 3,6 percents were older. The situation in Italy was rather different, as the majority of people were middle-aged, the quater of all the Italy were older than 60 years old that is much more than in Yemen. 
Projections of population in these countries promise that balance of the children and adults is going to be ruined and the percentage of middle-aged is going to become almost 60, while the quantity of old people is going to increase in 1,5 time. In Italy, in opposite to Yemen, the amount of people between 15 and 59 years is going to decrease from 61,6% to 46,2%. As a result, the part of old people is going to get smaller on almost twenty percent.
