The problem of public health is an actual problem, that is discussed in every country. The opinions about this problem are very different. 
There is a point of view, that the rise of sport facilities is a measure enough to improve public health. On the one hand it is true, sport plays an important role in improving of health. People, which have a habit to run in the morning, for example, are in better form then other and they have fewer probability to become ill. Sport has a positive impact on people's health, it knows everyone. 
But on the other hand I don't agree with this opinion. I think, that increase of the number of sport facilities is not the best way to improve public health. 
There is a lot of factors, that influence public health. First of all, people's health depends on ecology. 
If the air is not fresh and the water is poluted, people can became many illnesses and sport will not help. Second, it is very important to improve and develop a medicine. As we know, in countries with high level of medicine development the average length of life is higher than in other countries, as an example can be compared Germany and Russia. 
The other significant factor of people's health is eating. People should try to eat healthy food and restrict eating of fast-food, chips, gas-water like cola, etc.
