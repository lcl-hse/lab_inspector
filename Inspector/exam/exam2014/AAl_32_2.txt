Nowadays, there is a popular suggestion about equality of men and women, so, universities ought to take students half to half. It is true or false? That is not an casy question and many factors have to be concidered. 
Concerning to me, this suggestion is wrong . Of course, both - female and male are equal in rights - there is no any discrimination. However, we should apply the psychology of men's and women's choice to solve this problem. Firstly, there are faculties, where men's qualities are incredibly needed. As for example building, engineering and so on. Of course, there are profession where females dominate - teaching, cooking... The next question is about interests of our categories. It is known that girls like to treat dolls, look for their brothers and sisters whenever boys are keen on construsting buildings, mechanisms of crushing them. I suggest that childhood plays unbelieveuble role in the growth of character, qualities of person . Actually, there is no question only in psychology. We should also remind physical circumstances. I suggest that there is low population of females are interested in profwssion of policeman or fire fighter because physical training are really needed for this type of work. 
Taking all these facts into consideration my conclusion is that equal number of male and female student in every subject is possible but there is no practical benefit. There can be consequences which will be hard to correct - person will do the job, which he or she doesn't like or cannot do.
