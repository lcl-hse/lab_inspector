Creative mind, actions, strategy... Including the word "creative" we make some spheres more unusial, more popular, more competitive. Sometimes "creative" interprets like "new and progressive". On the on hand, it is really so. On the other hand, it is only one kind of mindness, someone's behaviour or so on. It is true that artists are pioneers of introducing creative ideas. However, they are extremely independent and there are different points of view of the quantity of freedom which should be given to artists. 
On the one hand, creative ideas generates mostly in the atmosphere of freedom to express yourself. You can make mysterious photos or paint something unusual, you can dance in the way you like or play music instruments creating dangerous melodies, you can act in the film or take place in the performance. You are free. You are creator of your life and your way of thinking. You can do everything... In this atmosphere people can create unexpective ideas or something else. 
On the other hand, sometimes the actions of creative artists hurt the feelings of citizens. The poems, pictures and films also can be the reason of human anger to each other or to some small groups (gay or lesbian, black-skined people, vegetarians and so on). Moreover, nowadays it is popular to tell everyone about your political preferences through your masterpieces of art. It is clear that governments try to restrict the freedom of express of such artists. 
As for me? I think that the government should give artists enough freedom, but sometimes it also can restrict their activities to save the public order in the country. Uncontrolled freedom can be the illness of our society, time to time we should restrict it, but doing it very carefully, with the understanding of the situation not only in your country, but also in the world.
