There are different opinions about how to improve public health. Some people think that increasing the number of sports facilities will help to make people healthier, others consider that there are better ways to improve public health. On the one hand, people will become healthier if they do sports. Sport activities make our body healthy and nice looking. It cannot be denied that nowadays less and less people are interested in sport. First of all it happens because of increasing of alternative ways of time spanding and high prices at different sport sections. For example, in my native town there are very few places where you can do sports, but there a big deal of cinemas, department stores and so on. That is why we have little number of health persons. If you want to do some sport you need a lot of money. On the other hand, our environment influence on our health very much. Today people live in huge industrial cities with polluted air and water. There is no doubt that the Earth is becomming dangerous for people, because they cause a great many of ecological disasters. For instance, some centuries ago people were much healthier because of pure environment, so we should try to make our planet cleaner and safier. More than that, the way of producing food is becomming more harmful for people's health. In conclusion, I would like to stress that there are different ways to improve people's health. In my opinion, both ways are necessary. People should have much more sport facilities and make the place where they live less polluted and less harmfull for health.
