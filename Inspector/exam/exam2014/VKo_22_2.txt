Nowadays the question of creative person's freedom has been as urgent as it has never been before. New kinds of modern art has appeared every year and representatives of them want to be heard. They claim their right to create cannot be restricted while common people insiste on restriction. Let's consider both opinions. 
I have always been sure that freedom is above everything. Noone can limit it. Whereas I understand that there are some rules and laws according to them we are living for. If one are allowed to break any rules, others will follow them. In total our democratic society becomes anarchy one. I can easily proove it by giving you an example of an amazing survey. It was a modern block of flats in suburbans of New York. The only strange thing of that house was nobody lived there. It had been standing for several years and nothing changed. One day scientists decided to break one glass there to proove the theory. What happened in 3 months? All glasses were broke and walls were painted. It means, scientists said, that when people observe abnormal behaviour they strive to follow him. That's why if we allow creative artists behave abnormal we allow it to everybody. 
Creative ones disagree with this point of view. They consider them to be artists and should do what they want. I suppose such process to be inevitable and people not only in my country face such problem. 
Summing up everything said above I can draw a conclusidion that the best solution of this problem is to find a golden middle, Local government should creat special areas for artists and artists have to follow the rules. So they ought to have a dialoge.
