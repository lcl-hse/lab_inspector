Nowadays, health issues are really great in terms of importance. Every person worries about his or her health problems. But how such problems could be solved? Today there are two main points of view on this question. 
First of all, some people claim that the more sports facilities are the healthier people are. The lack of neccessary sports equipment is the main problem as they say. People need more gyms, yards with sports facilities and so on. Their idea looks like: "A gym a day - keeps the doctor away". 
On the other hand, there is another point of view. Others people are persuaded that such way of improving public health is useless. Health problems are not always connected with sport. Moreover, sport could be a reason of different illnesses. So, a lot of other measures should be required. 
As for me, both opinions are very essential. Nevertheless, my point of view gravitates to the first one. I consider that being a sportish person means being a healthy person. Man or woman cannot avoid all illnesses, but with sports activities it would be much easier. Furthermore, sport does not provide any health, but also gives beautiful body. Keeping fit means being fashionable today. Last but not least is that a person will be less strsssful with sport. When you are under a big pressure you can relax due to sport and have a nice mood. All that points are the reasons of my opinion. Sport help people to be healthy and happy. That is why new equipment will improve public health. 
To sum up, there are a lot of different opinions health problems. However, I choose the point of view about sports' importance. I am strongly persuaded that it is worth doing sports.
