Some people are confident that universities have to take the same amount of men and women to each subject or faculty in oder to share ideals of tolerance in the all over the world. But I don't understand with this point of view, I admit that proportion of men and women in universities should be depend on only result of examination. On the one hand, it is clear that a lot of people want to see same number of different sexes in any sphere of our life. All people should have common rights and no one group of people does not deserve to be higher then other. But if students are going to be chosen by their sex it will be really untolerate situation. Men and women have to know that there is nothing what linked with their natural spicies and that is why each of them should be hard-working and have good skills to get what they want. 
Moreover, how may the results of exams be honest if director of universities would take students only for proportional criteria? To my point of view, I cannot really realise how such system could work in real situation. It would change all educational system at all! I am confident that this idea does not cost such problems and difficulties. 
To sum up, it is important to say that there are must be right opportunities for all kind of people in all sphere of our life. But people should not be to radical in their wishes because that way often is too dangerous to realise and may lead to unexpectable results.
