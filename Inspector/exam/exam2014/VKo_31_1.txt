The graph indicates different levels of education in Australia and both men and women involved in 1999. 
Overall, the main trend seems surprising: mens are more likely to improve their qualification until postgraduated diploma and master's degree then females. Even more, just 10% of women have skilled vocational diploma comparing to 90% of males. The another tendency can be clearly seen from the chart: after receiving the SV diploma women's interest to studying declines gradually (from 70% of females having undergraduate diploma to 30% having postgraduate one). By contrast, the reverse trend is among men's preferences: there is a gently rise from practically 40% owing undergraduate diploma to almost to 70% postgraduated. 
To summarize all the information: today's most popular level of education, bachelor's degree, was slightly more common among females in 1999, comparing to nowadays when the number of men and women attending bachelor's degree practically levels off.
