According to the graph, we can see the proportion of population in the USA, Japan and Sweden. So, our research was narrowed, because the graph shows the proportion only for 65 y.o. and over. Firstly, we have to notice a great period of time, including the predicting for about 30 years. Firstly I noticed the graph of Japan population. We can see an extremely rising up graph, after the 2030th. Before that, really low positions of Japan could be caused by the Nuclear explosions in Hirosima and Nagosaki, and after-explosion results: as mutations and cancer. So, in 2030th the generation of Hirosima tragedy will be ended. Graphs of the USA and Sweden are mostly similar, arising(?) for about 60 years, from 1940 to 2000. Here, we can see, that the USA graph goes down, from 2000 to 2020. falling down is only on 2%, but it has a too much obvious difference with the Sweden graph. So, American soldiers from Vietnam got different diseases, also the American system of healthcare negatively changing to become a state institute… so we noticed the passing (?), of the US graph. Anyway, the graph of Sweden proportion of population shows an extremely jump up for 5%! Frankly speaking I don't know way. Anyway, the common results of all three graphs (?), in 2030th are really high, because of absense of big wars and more other important reasons.
