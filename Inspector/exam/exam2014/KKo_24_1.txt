The chart shows the information about total minutes (in billions) of telephone calls in the United Kingdom from 1995-2002 divided into three categories: local and national/international fixed line and mobile calls. We can see from the chart that local calls are the most popular and mobile calls are less popular throughout the period, but the situation tend to change, as mobile calls, having relatively low numbers at the beginning of the period from 1995 to 2000 rapidly become much popular during 2000s, with almost 10 times more minutes of calls in 2002 than in 1995. National and international calls have a steady increase in the number of call minutes throughout the period, paining about 2-5 billions a year. Local fixed line calls had a peak in 1999, steadily rising until this year and starting to lose positions at almost the same rate after. 
In general, we can see an increase in total number of call minutes, and mobile calls have became significantly more popular in 2002 than in 1995, while other types of calls have ether a relatively moderate increase, as national/international telephone calls, or maintaining almost the same number of minutes in 2002 as in 1995 (local fixed line calls).
