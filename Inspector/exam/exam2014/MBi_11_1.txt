The information provided illustrates the proportion of people aged 65 and over living in USA, Japan and Sweden from 1940 to 2040. The information is given in graphs. 
It can be deduced from the graph that the number of old people in Japan was quite low and declined from 5 percent to about 3 percent between 1940 and 1985, but in 1985 started to raise and demonstrated five time increase during the period worth discussing. In contrast, the proportion of population aged 65 and over in the USA remained raising dramatically from about 10 percent in 1940 to almost 25 percent in 2040 with unsignificant declines (between 1980 and 2010). Similarly, it can be seen that the population aged 65 and over in Sweden rise from about 7 percent in 1940 to 25 percent in 2040, demonstrated the higher number than in the USA. 
Overall, it can be said that the proportion of old population in Japan rise significantly and now is higher then in the USA and in Sweden, while these two countries illustrate the stable increase during the period under discussion.
