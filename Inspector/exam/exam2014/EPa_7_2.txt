Nowadays, more and more people unhealthy and who have different problem with health. I agree with this statement. I think that created new the number of sports facilities. Is good idea. But also I agree with people who say that it is little effect to do people health. In modern life people don't can without different technology such as computer, mobile phone, car and other. People very busy in 21 centery and don't have a time on sports exercises. Instead they begining smoke, drink alchohol. Modern population needed in advertising good health. People have to understand that thae needed in sports. Public health very important for society. Different competitions helps people to achieve success in different sphere. Also people can communicated with other people and knows new information. Increase the number of sports facilities. On my opinion have to help people think that they improve public health. 
Also in modern society have people who cared about health. They visited fitness clubs to do different sports exersice. Also they eat good and healthy product such as vegetables, meat which cooked on water, (hot air) and drink juice, also they drink different vitamins. 
In conclusion I want to say that public health is very important for people. Because it is very, very important for two next population, how much people live in world in the features and how they will develop in the features. Created new sports facilities is good idea because people look that they can visited different sports and to go in sports.
