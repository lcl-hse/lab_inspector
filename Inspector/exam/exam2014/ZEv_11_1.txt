The first chart illustrates changes in number of people making the UK and number of UK citizens travelling abroad according to years. The second cart provides the information about countries which englishmen find most attractive for visiting. 
In the first chart we can see that in early 80s numbers of tourists slightly outweighted the number of englishmen going overseas. Although there was a significant groth in both numbers, but the rupture between UK residents travelling abroad and those, who visit England even increased. 
As far as the second chart is concerned, the most preferrable country for tourism according to englishmen is France(about 11 mln of visitors in 1999). The second two popular countries are Spain and USA which met 9 and 4 mln. of tourists from England respectively. Greece and Turkey are also frequently visited by people from UK, but not as much as France and Spain. 
To sum up, I can say that overall number of travelling in or from England has rocketed since the 80s, but there are still more tourist going to the UK than locals travelling overseas. The most often visited countries by English tourists are Spain and France, followed by USA, Greece and Turkey.
