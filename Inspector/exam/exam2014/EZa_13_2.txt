In today's world everybody is very busy because of the millions of plans, career path, fancily deals, but it's obvious that every person wants just to be happy. Why to be happy is so essential and what a person should do for feeling happiness. 
To start with happiness is the feeling of comfort and security. However all people are different and they have different understandings of "comfort" and "security" that is why, it is so difficult to give an explanation of happiness. 
Nevertheless, there are some basic factors that are important for achieving happiness. Firstly it is the support of family and friends, personal relationships. A human being is dependent on society and communication. So, it is necessary to have close friends and good family relations. 
Secondly, a person should feel his or her own freedom. It is very important not to be rebel but know that you always have a choice. 
Thirdly, it is difficult to imagine happy unhealthy man because a health is one of the most important factors that influence on a person's attitude to life. 
As for me, I remember how happy I was when my little sister was born. I felt close connection with all my family, with my parents. I was happy for us. I know that she was healthy and that her birth was a conscious decision of my parents. We gathered together and I'm strictly sure we were happy. 
In conclusion I want to say that every person has his or her own secret of happiness and I hope everyone will find his or her way to achieve it.
