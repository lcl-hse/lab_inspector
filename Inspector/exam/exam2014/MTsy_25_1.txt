This charts pictured the indexes of the ages of the population of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and future indexes in 2050. 
In 2000 in Yemen children from 0 to 14 consisted almost a half from all population. The number of them should decrease to 20505. the number of older people, aded from 15 to 59 years will increase in 11 percent. The percentage of the oldest people will rise too. In 2000 people aded 60 years and older consisted only 3,6% of all the population of Yemen, but 50 years later there will be 5,7% of them. 
The similar situation is in Italy according to the charts. The number of children will decrease in 3 per cent by 2050. The number of people older than 60 years will increase in 18 per cent (from 24,1% to 42,3%). 
The most global point that is not similar for both countries is that in Yemen the population of middle-aged people will increase, but in Italy this index will decrease. Also it should be point out that the main part of the populations of both countries consist from people aged from 15 to 59.
