Nowadays culture has a big difference from the culture in past. In past we had only few main kinds of art: music, art, literature, arhitecture, theatre, and, probably, the clothes. But now there are new types of art: films, photography, excebitions. Thanks to new technologies films consist more special effects, music became more electronic and simple photos with views of nature (which can do any kid) are admitted like an art of high level. World become free: there are few wars, more gays and lesbians. And what about art? Is it more freedom in culture expression and expression of different individuals? And is it good or not? 
Well, in my point of view, artists can have a freedom. The first, as I said earlier, today the world is more free. The second - art is expression of culture, the whole word and the current period of time. If we sum up these two sentenses, we can say that the artnowadays should reflect the freedom and governments can't be against it. 
Furthermore, to my mind, art that made by modern creative artists, can tribute to the freedom. For example, concerts of famous singers like Madona and Lady Gaga are have a message, that world should become more free, that there shouldn't be some wars, that people with anothe sex orientation shouldn't be judged etc. I believe, that when young people listen their songs and visit and see their concerts, they become inspired and make the world better by little things. 
In conclusion, I would like to say, that politics should allow to creative artists to do what they want to do and make an art in the way they want to see it. And if it bad for children physic - it is a problem of parents.
