Our society are often named as a society of assumption. It means that all we have done is for achieving the happiness. However, there is no strong definition of happiness and only hesitations about the models of its getting. Therefore, there are two common questions of human existence, which I am going to answer through my own opinion. 
I understand the definition "happiness" as a funny, temporally, successful and the most desirable human states or feeling. For instance, if I achieve all my desires and my dreams come true, I will feel the happiness. According to the speech of the main player of the film "The pursuit of happyness" happiness is the feeling when you get the most wanted things despite many difficulties you had in your past. As can be seen it has almost the same meaning. 
Therefore, I suppose that factors in getting happiness might be similar for many people and can be divided to external and internal. 
According to my view, external factors may include having a home, car, high-paid loved work and family. These factors are dependent not only from us, but also from others. 
However, we cannot forget an internal factors like a healthy of our mind, our self-esteem, which are depended from us, bu the most difficulty changed. 
In conclusion, I want to add that each definition of happiness is unique and individual and the steps of reaching happiness are changing due to its definition.
