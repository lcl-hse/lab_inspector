Life in the 21st century is very fast and busy. People need to be strong to deal with everyday stress and to fight with enviromental pollutions. To do it successfully, it is necessery to have stronger immunity system and better health. Problem of saving public health has always been a crusial problem. 
On of the easiest and availiable ways to improve public health is to increase the number of sports facilities. 
Some people believe that it way not be enough though. Moreover, some are even consirned that too much sport may be dangerous for people's lives. They suggest to improve guality of public hospitals, to make life ensuarance cheaper. 
In the same time, their opponents believe that sports can make everything better. There are many examples that demonstrate positive influence of sports on people. 
Is dports facilities are availiable for people, then starting with young ages people find it as great hobbies, they want to work on themselves. They hava a strong motivation to get better in something, so they have no time for bad habits or unhealthy lifestyle. Let's take, for example, the US. People there come into sports in kinder gardens and sports always takes a sighnificant part of their lives. And we consider the US as a strong healthy nation. The same was with the Soviet Union. 
Personally, I do believe that a larger number of sports facilities will greatly affect public health. When people do sports, they start to care more about what they eat, how much they sleep, how good they feel themselves and, of course, they have a better mental health. 
In conclusion, I'd like to say that public health problem is important and we have to look at it from different aspects. It would be great, if our government would provide as with sports facilities as well as with a good and reliable medicine.
