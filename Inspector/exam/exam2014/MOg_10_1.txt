The table gives us some details about the underground systems in six cities. 
Considering the age of these systems, it can be notices that the oldest one is located in London and was built in 1863. The youngest underground railway system was opened in 2001 in Los Angeles, more than a century after the London's one. Another important thing is the size of the systems. Expectedly, the largest is in London, which route is 394 kilometres long. Then goes Paris with 199 kilometres long system, third place takes Tokyo (155 kilometres) and the fourth is Washington DC (126 kilometres). Last two places go to Kyoto and Los Angeles with less developed systems, 11 and 28 kilometres long respectively. 
The interesting fact is that underground railway system in Tokyo lets 1927 million passengers to travel through per year, which is almost three times more than the system in London can afford, despite the second one is more than twice larger.
