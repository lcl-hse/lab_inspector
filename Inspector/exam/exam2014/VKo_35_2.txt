Creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or film) in whichever way they wish. There should be no government restrictions on what they do. To what extend to you agree or disagree with this opinion? 
It goes without saying that artists are people who need a lot of freedom in all ways for the possibility to create something. This means that they are sure that any restriction of their way of life will influence their inspiration and will spoil their work. In which degree should the government restrict creative artists? Let's think about it. 
To my mind, the government shouldn't limit the activity of artists. It is out of the questions, that artists are those people who can change the history and the culture. One generation change into another but the art is saving from the earliest centuries to nowadays. It demonstrate that artists should be respectable in society, they should have a lot of advantages, because they are unusual people. This means that the government also shouldn't influence the artists' way of life in such way as ideological restrictions. 
On the other hand, artists are also the citizens of a concrete country. It is clear that they as everyone in this government should have some political duties like taxing and so on. In this way, in my opinion, creative artists of course should have government restrictions. 
Thus, I would like to say, that artists are very important people in the world, they play a very significant role, but it's not the reason not to restrict them as other citizens.
