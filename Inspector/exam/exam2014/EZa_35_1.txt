The pie chart shows that most of electricity is used for heating rooms and water. 17,5% percents of electricity used for ovens, kettles, washing machines and 15%percents for lighting, TV and radio. Also 15 percents used for vacuum cleaners, food mixers, electric tools. 
Demand for electricity lower at summer because rooms and water heaters did not work for some reasons. Well... because it is not needed. However rising of demand for electricity i the evening is end of work day product. Peoples go to home and start using TV, radio and lighting. Before work day people using ovens, vacuum cleaners, food mixers and electric tools of any sort. the demand for electricity in English homes between midnight and nine hours PM is lower than another hours because most of peoples are sleeping.
