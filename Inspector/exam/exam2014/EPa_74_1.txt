The pie charts below illustrates data on the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and give some expectations on future situation in 2050. At the first glance, it is clear that in every country except Yemen in 2000 the majority of population consists of people from 15 to 59 years. As for Yemen, there is some significant changes over 50 years period. Particularly, percentage of generation aged from 15 to 59 is predicted to grow by just above 10 percent, whereas it is expected that the share of children not older 14 years dramatically reduce from about 50 percent to 37. Number of retired people will not change significantly. 
The opposite situation can be seen in Italy. It's expected that baby boom may happen and share of children will rise significantly to 42,3% by 2050. Simultaneously, there will be reduction of middle-eged population, while percentage of older people remain, presumably, on the same level. 
To sum up, some changes took place in those two countries and they are opposite.
