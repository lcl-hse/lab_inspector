Apropos of the statement, that creative peooke should be absolutely free in their work, I am consummate discord. Personnaly, I share the point of view which includes that government should control what artists do. 
There are a lot of short comings of giving freedom to artists. For example, government should ban or short to demonstrate to publicy films, which could be dangerous foir majority. They could contain scenes of violentcy, and consequences for children could be awful and devasting for these mentality. 
Furthermore, some of modern films ampnd other kinds of culture could have erotic contain which could cause bad effect too. For solution of this problem government should make a serias of laws, which base on timing and aging restrictions. 
On the other hand, some people think that any control from the government have tyhe devasting effect on own culture and art. But if we abate the choices from the laws, it could stay thge source of anguishes of a loit of people in the future. People should sustain their and any children health and well being. 
In the nutshell, art of our country should develop in accord to laws and rules of their country and society. Hence, abscence of any government restrictions could be dangerous, harmful and devasting for people.
