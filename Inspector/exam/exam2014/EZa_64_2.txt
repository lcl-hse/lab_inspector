Nowadays there are a lot of people, who choose an art as a profession. But strict rules which are wtitten in law sometimes bring difficulties for creative people to show whatever they want. 
To begin with, it is clear that artists should have more freedom in realizing themselves. Some rules can be harmful not only for their personality, but for their career at all. Secondly, some ways of expression the feelings are really helpful for creative person, but they can seem to be rude and unpleasant for other people. This misunderstanding can be bad for both sides of the conflict. And if the artist is careful about feelings of other people and does not act as he want in sight this way of expression becomes useless, because artist without viewers is nothing. 
On the other hand there are some situations when creative people go mad and do a lot of harm with their actions. Sometimes they can think that they bring art through pain. One more fact is about street artists. Their art is to draw on the buildings. 
For some people it seems really beautiful, but for some it is a unrespect of the history and architecture. 
On this basis, I can conclude that every person, artistic or not, should know rules, which are followed by the community, where he lives.
