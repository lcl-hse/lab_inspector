The following charts illustrate the data of percentage among different age groups in Yemen and Italy collected in 2000 and some future predictions for 2050. 
From the charts it can be seen that the amount of people in Yemen aged from 0 to 14 years is likely to decrease from 50,1% in 2000 to 37,0% in 2050. The number of Yemen's people who are from 15 to 59 years old is supposed to increase by 11 per cent. The same projection is done for the older people (from 60 years old): this group is also expected to become bigger (the percentage is: 3.6% in 2000 and 5.7% in 2050). 
According to the charts the young population of Italy (aged from 0 to 14) was 14.3% in 2000 year. This number is supposed to decline to the 2050 year. The amount of people aged from 15 to 59 is the majority of the whole Italian population. It took 61.6% in 2000 and is expected to breakdown to 46.2%. The older part of population in Italy, on the contrary, is about to increase considerably (from 24.1% to 42.3%). 
To sum up, there can be seen a tendency in decreasing of the amount of people aged from 0 to 59, while the older group shows the opposite trend in both countries.
