There were an investigations, that showed the importance of features and characteristics we are born with. The point is: our life time experience has a smaller influence on our personality, than 'native' characteristics. Some people agree with that, others believe in opposite point of view. 
On the one hand, genetic issues play essential role in development of personality. That makes people differ from one another. So, the foundation of our shills, and future achievements is what we already have in genes: our personal features. It is easy to illustrate this phenomenon by giving example of music players. We all know, if somebody has no music talent, it would be difficult for him or her to become composer or dancer, for instance. 
On the other hand, we cannot leave our future only on talents we were born with. Everybody should work to improve yourself. Even if something is failed or going wrong because of lack of talents, it is not a reason to give up. So, there sould not be excuses like: "It is not my type of activity". In this type of situations people should make up your mind and do their best to reach the aim. Let's take musicians as an example too. Even if is hard to become professional violyn-player without such talent, it is possible for everybody. Somebody just should work harder. This things will make person strong as a person and will construct his or her personality. 
In conclusion, there are a lot of factors, besides genes, that are vital in personality building. For example, culture or community. So, it is undoubtly important to work on personality and character even though there are no special talent, which somebody was born with.
