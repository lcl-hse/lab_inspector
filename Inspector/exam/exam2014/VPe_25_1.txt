There are two charts that show the principal reasons for study among students of different age groups and the amount of support they received from employers. 
On the first there are results of quantity of people who study for career or for interest. In the group of "under 26" approximately 80 per cent interest. With the age results change. As for people who study for career results drop slightly. For example : in the group from 26 to 29 years old it is around 70 percent, for the 30 - 39 years old group result's are lower, it is less than 60 per cent, as for the 40 - 49 years old group results showed that they study as well for career as for interest. The bouth results have 40 per cent. Results for people who study for interest differ. The highest number of people who study, for interest are from the group "over 49", it is 70 per cent. The lowest result showed people from the group "under 26", it is 10 per cent. 
The second graph shows the amount of support that students received from employers. We can see that the highest results were showed by the group of "under 26", it is approximately 65 per cent. The lowest results are around 35 per cent by 30 - 39 years old group.

People from 30 to 39 are not good for employers, but more than 80 percent of them are studying for career. People from the group "over 49" are studying for interest in general, but also they receive the amount from employers.
