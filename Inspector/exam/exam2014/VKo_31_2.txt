In the modern world there is an widely spread opinion that creative artists deserve more freedom then others to make performance the most fruitful. Even more, the government's influence should be excluded. I partly agree with this believe. From my point of view, creative people should not be restricted in a way of representing their ideas. Nevertheless, they are also a part of cruel society, thus they have to observe many rules accepted by the local government as other citizens do. 
Some people believe that creative figures are practically ubiquitous. For instance, there are many representatives of modern art who have already become extremely successful. It's because of large spaces of exibhitions opened for audience, and good proportion. It all should be legal for up-and-coming artists as well as to professionalists. Someone may claim that modern art is stupid and primitive, but in every craft there is somebody who will appreciate it. 
From the other hand, the creativity should be placed in certain frames. As I already said, the law is working for everyone. In this way, creative people should use some conventional forms of performans and it shouldn't contain some extremistic or radical ideas. However, degree of allowance vary among countries with different policy. [], for example, democracy when almost all the kind of art is legal, but exeptions always exist. 
In conclusion we can say that creative people should have an access to a large area of creativity, because often they can produce a masterpiece. But we should also consider that "all the unconvinient activity should be performed in convinient way", it meens that according to the law and government's permission.
