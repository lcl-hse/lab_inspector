Nowadays higher education become an ordinar part of human's life, for example in my country more than 80 percent of people have it. But, unfortunately, there a stereo type that woman should study social science wheras man should study natural science. However, I don't think that accepting equal numbr of the main human both sex in all subject can change situation. I believe that problem is that female just do not choose the "male" subjects. 
What I mean, from the childhood our sociaty make us to determinate some subjects as are "male" and other as a "female". It teach children that girls should be quiet and play dolls wheras boys should be more agressive and play with solgers and when they grown up female do not choose some subjects because that think that it is not femine. 
Moreover, if any female student want to study chemistry or something like that, she have to bear with a lot of problems. Male students and professors often don't trust in female stuudent abilites and, for example, give her a lower marks, so some girls afraid to choose "more subject". 
And the last but not the list, our laws in theory, give all people equal rights don't matter what sex they have. If someone is quite talented to pass the exam, he or she will study in the university. The system with an equal numbers of male and female can be unjustice in situation when the person is talanted but there is no place for she or he because of hisor her gender. 
To sum up, sociaty should fight against gender injustice in all aspects of our life such as injustice, but some time it is better just to give an equal chances more than try to make an equal number.
