Nowadays people's illnesses are an urgent problem. Some people believe that increasing the number of sport facilities is the best way to improve public health, whereas others consider that it brings a little effect on people's health and need other measures are required. 
I personally think, that sport lifestyle helps people to support their body and mind of healthy forms. Doing sport regulary, for example running, provides people with oxygen and good mood. A lot of numbers of sport facilities help people to correct their body and health at whole. Swimming is the best way to correct problems with bag or legs. Sport lifestyle is the key to be healthy, slim and beautiful. Peoples, doing fitness frequently, feel theselves better than others, because they do some exercices, eat healthy food, rich minerals and other elements. Moreover, badminton practice helps people to change their problems with eyes. 
Others people argue that advantages from sport exercises have a little impact on people's health. Spending time on the seas brings a lot of benefits, because people get a sun, sea air and other useful things. Moreover, regular visits with doctors provide people with some advice and prescription about their health. Massage services have a good influence on people, who have problems with parts of their body. Finally, eating healthy food and getting vitamins help people to encourage their body. 
To sum up, I totally agree with people, who think that doing sport regulary provides people with health and good form. People should visit their doctors regulary, eat only healthy food and do sport, to be healthy.
